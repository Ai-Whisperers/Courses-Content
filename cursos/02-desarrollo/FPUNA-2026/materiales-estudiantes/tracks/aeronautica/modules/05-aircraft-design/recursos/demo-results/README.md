# Class 5 Demo Results

This directory contains the outputs generated by running the Aeronautics Class demos and exercises.

## 1. Flight Data Analysis

**Source:** `exercises/class-05-flight-analysis/solution_demo.py`
**Output:** `flight_analysis_results.png`

This chart shows the altitude profile and current consumption. Note the red dots indicating detected anomalies (current spikes) during the aggressive maneuver phase.

## 2. Generative Design (Topology Optimization)

**Source:** `recursos/class-05-design-demos/topology_opt_demo.py`
**Output:** `generative_beam_result.png`

This image shows the "organic" structure evolved by the algorithm to support a cantilever load. Darker areas represent material kept for structural integrity.

## 3. Parametric Design (AI Drone Designer)

**Source:** `recursos/class-05-design-demos/drone_designer.py`
**Output:** `drone_design.scad`

This is a 3D model script generated by the AI based on the prompt: _"Payload: 0.5kg, Endurance: 45min"_.
You can view it using [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org/).
