## The #1 Mistake Students Make

**Reading about prompts instead of writing them.**

You cannot learn prompt engineering by reading examples. You learn by experimenting, failing, iterating, and discovering what works through practice.

## How This Course Works

```
Learn Concept (15 min) → Write Prompts (30 min) → Test & Compare → Refine → Save Best → Move On
                               ↓
                          Log results in your experiment tracker
```

Every prompt you write teaches you something. The failed prompts teach you the most.

## Time Commitment

| Path | Time Per Week | Total Duration | Best For |
|------|---------------|----------------|----------|
| **Intensive** | 10-15 hours | 2-3 weeks | Quick upskilling |
| **Standard** | 5-8 hours | 4-5 weeks | Working professionals |
| **Part-time** | 3-4 hours | 6-8 weeks | Casual learners |

**Minimum session**: 45 minutes. You need time to experiment and iterate.

## How to Study Each Module

### Step 1: Pre-read (5 minutes)
- Skim the README headings
- Look at the exercise requirements  
- Understand what technique you're learning

### Step 2: Learn the Concept (15-20 minutes)
- Read the full lesson
- **Try each example prompt yourself** (don't just read them)
- Notice how small changes affect output

### Step 3: Experiment (30-45 minutes)
- Complete the exercises
- Try variations on your own
- Test with BOTH Claude and ChatGPT (they respond differently)

### Step 4: Document (10 minutes)
- Save your best prompts to your library
- Log what worked and what didn't
- Note patterns you discovered

### Step 5: Quiz (10 minutes)
- Test your understanding
- Review incorrect answers
- Revisit concepts as needed

## Your Prompt Library is Everything

Start building it from Day 1. Structure it like this:

```
prompt-library/
├── templates/           # Reusable patterns
│   ├── writing/
│   ├── analysis/
│   ├── coding/
│   └── research/
├── experiments/         # A/B tests and iterations
│   └── YYYY-MM-DD/
├── results/             # Outputs worth keeping
└── course-exercises/    # Completed course work
```

**The real deliverable of this course is YOUR prompt library, customized to YOUR work.**

## If Your Prompt Isn't Working

Follow this debugging flowchart:

```
Prompt not giving good results?
           │
           ▼
Is the task clear? (Would a human understand?)
           │
      No ──┴── Yes
       │         │
       ▼         ▼
  Rewrite task  Is there enough context?
   more clearly        │
                  No ──┴── Yes
                   │         │
                   ▼         ▼
              Add context  Is the output format specified?
                                  │
                             No ──┴── Yes
                              │         │
                              ▼         ▼
                        Add format   Try few-shot examples
                        instructions        │
                                            ▼
                                     Try a different model
                                            │
                                            ▼
                                     Break into smaller steps
```

**Rule of thumb**: If the AI misunderstands, it's almost always a prompting problem, not an AI problem.

## The Prompt Quality Checklist

Before declaring any prompt "done", check:

- [ ] **Clear task**: Would a human understand what to do?
- [ ] **Sufficient context**: Does it have all needed information?
- [ ] **Specific format**: Is the expected output structure clear?
- [ ] **Appropriate tone**: Does it specify voice/style if needed?
- [ ] **Tested on both models**: Does it work on Claude AND ChatGPT?
- [ ] **Reproducible**: Does it give consistent results?

## What Makes Top Students Different

Based on observing 100+ students:

| Top 10% Do This | Bottom 10% Do This |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| Test every example themselves | Just read the examples |
| Keep detailed experiment logs | Lose track of what they tried |
| Build a personal library | Don't save their prompts |
| Test on multiple AI models | Only use one tool |
| Iterate 5-10 times per prompt | Give up after 2 tries |
| Apply techniques to real work | Only do course exercises |

## Tracking Your Progress

Use this checklist for each module:

```markdown
## Module [X] Progress

- [ ] Pre-read lesson headings
- [ ] Read full lesson
- [ ] Tried all example prompts myself
- [ ] Completed exercise (saved to library)
- [ ] Tested prompts on Claude
- [ ] Tested prompts on ChatGPT
- [ ] Logged experiments and results
- [ ] Passed quiz (80%+)
- [ ] Can explain technique to someone else
```

Copy this into a file called `MY-PROGRESS.md` and update as you go.

## The Most Important Habit

**Daily prompting practice.**

Even 15 minutes of experimentation daily beats 3 hours on weekends. Your brain needs repetition to internalize patterns.

**Try this**: Every day, take one task from your actual work and use it as prompt practice. Real stakes = real learning.
