## Section 2: True/False (5 questions, 1 point each)

### Question 11
True or False: Every text-based task should be automated with AI for maximum efficiency.

### Question 12
True or False: Testing a prompt template with real scenarios is essential before deploying it.

### Question 13
True or False: ROI for AI workflows only counts if you're saving more than 50% time.

### Question 14
True or False: Team members should be able to suggest improvements to shared workflows.

### Question 15

## Section 3: Scenario-Based Questions (5 questions, 1 point each)

### Question 16
**Scenario**: You've built a workflow that saves 15 minutes per occurrence, but it only applies to a task you do once a month.

**Question**: Is this workflow worth maintaining?

A) No - the savings are too small
B) Yes - 3 hours saved per year plus it's a template for other workflows
C) Only if you can increase the frequency
D) No - only weekly+ tasks are worth automating

### Question 17
**Scenario**: Your prompt template produces great results 80% of the time, but sometimes needs significant editing.

**Question**: What should you do?

A) Discard the template since it's not perfect
B) Analyze the 20% failure cases and refine the template
C) Use it as-is and accept the variability
D) Create a completely different template

### Question 18
**Scenario**: A teammate wants to use your workflow but their task has slightly different inputs.

**Question**: What's the BEST approach?

A) Tell them the template won't work for them
B) Create a variation of the template for their use case
C) Ask them to modify their task to fit the template
D) Build them an entirely new workflow

### Question 19
**Scenario**: You measured your workflow saves 20 minutes per task, but quality review now takes 10 extra minutes.

**Question**: What's the actual time savings?

A) 20 minutes - the review is optional
B) 10 minutes - net savings after review
C) 30 minutes - review adds efficiency
D) Zero - should abandon the workflow

### Question 20
**Scenario**: Your organization hasn't approved AI tools yet, but you want to prepare.

**Question**: What can you do now?

A) Nothing until approval
B) Document current workflows and identify automation candidates for when approved
C) Use AI secretly
D) Wait for competitors to adopt first

## Answer Key

### Section 1: Multiple Choice

1. **B** - Repetitive with variations in content
   - *Explanation: AI excels at similar tasks with different details; it provides leverage without full custom work each time.*

2. **B** - Document the current process step by step
   - *Explanation: Understanding the current process is essential before designing improvements.*

3. **B** - Clear placeholders, context, instructions, and output format
   - *Explanation: Complete templates ensure consistent, quality results.*

4. **B** - Manual copy-paste with template organization
   - *Explanation: Starting simple allows learning before investing in complex integrations.*

5. **B** - Compare time, quality, and volume metrics before and after
   - *Explanation: Multiple metrics give a complete picture of productivity impact.*

6. **B** - Pilot with 2-3 people, refine, then expand
   - *Explanation: Piloting allows refinement before broader rollout.*

7. **B** - It's high frequency, moderate complexity, and low risk
   - *Explanation: These characteristics maximize value and minimize risk for early wins.*

8. **C** - Regularly based on feedback and results
   - *Explanation: Templates should evolve based on actual usage and outcomes.*

9. **B** - Automating tasks where human judgment is essential
   - *Explanation: Over-automation can reduce quality when human judgment is needed.*

10. **B** - When to use, steps, templates, examples, and troubleshooting
    - *Explanation: Complete documentation enables independent team adoption.*

### Section 2: True/False

11. **False** - Not every task is suitable; high-stakes and judgment-heavy tasks may not benefit.

12. **True** - Real-world testing reveals issues that theoretical review misses.

13. **False** - Even small time savings compound over time; 10-20% gains are valuable.

14. **True** - Continuous improvement requires feedback from users.

15. **False** - 10 minutes/week = 8+ hours/year; also serves as a template pattern for other workflows.

### Section 3: Scenario-Based

16. **B** - Yes - 3 hours saved per year plus it's a template for other workflows
    - *Explanation: Annual savings compound, and templates create foundation for other automation.*

17. **B** - Analyze the 20% failure cases and refine the template
    - *Explanation: Understanding failures leads to template improvement; 80% success is a starting point.*

18. **B** - Create a variation of the template for their use case
    - *Explanation: Variations extend value without forcing fit or duplicating effort.*

19. **B** - 10 minutes - net savings after review
    - *Explanation: True savings must account for any additional time required.*

20. **B** - Document current workflows and identify automation candidates for when approved
    - *Explanation: Preparation accelerates adoption when tools become available.*
