3. GATHER    → Collect relevant information
4. ANALYZE   → Have AI help synthesize findings
5. VALIDATE  → Cross-check important claims
6. DOCUMENT  → Create actionable summary
```

## Best Practices Summary

1. **Start with clear questions** - Know what you're trying to learn
2. **Verify important claims** - AI can be wrong; check key facts
3. **Triangulate sources** - Look for patterns across multiple inputs
4. **Note confidence levels** - Some findings are more certain than others
5. **Update regularly** - Research gets stale; build refresh cadence
6. **Document as you go** - Capture insights when they're fresh
7. **Connect to decisions** - Research should inform action

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

| Pitfall | Problem | Solution |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Outdated information | AI knowledge has cutoffs | Verify current data externally |
| Confirmation bias | Finding what you want to find | Ask for counterarguments |
| Over-reliance on AI | Missing primary research | Combine AI with direct sources |
| Unverified claims | AI can hallucinate statistics | Check every important number |
| Analysis paralysis | Endless research, no action | Define stopping criteria upfront |
| Lost knowledge | Research not documented | Build systematic capture process |
