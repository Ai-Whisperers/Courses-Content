## Answer Key

### Section 1: Multiple Choice

1. **B** - Context about what the data represents
   - *Explanation: AI needs to understand what the data means to provide relevant analysis.*

2. **C** - Verify key calculations independently
   - *Explanation: AI can make calculation errors; important numbers should be manually verified.*

3. **C** - Line chart
   - *Explanation: Line charts clearly show trends and changes over time.*

4. **B** - Column/row references and what data each contains
   - *Explanation: AI needs to understand data structure to create accurate formulas.*

5. **C** - AI can hallucinate or miscalculate; all results need verification
   - *Explanation: AI assistance doesn't guarantee accuracy; human verification is essential.*

6. **B** - Structured format (tables, lists) when possible
   - *Explanation: Structured formats make extracted information more usable and verifiable.*

7. **C** - Factual information from public sources
   - *Explanation: AI analysis is only as good as the factual input; public sources provide verifiable data.*

8. **B** - Provide time-series data and ask for specific pattern analysis
   - *Explanation: Specific data and questions yield better trend analysis than vague requests.*

9. **B** - The key insight or bottom-line conclusion
   - *Explanation: Executives need the main point first; details can follow.*

10. **C** - A clear narrative connecting data to business decisions
    - *Explanation: Data stories link insights to actionable decisions, not just present numbers.*

### Section 2: True/False

11. **False** - AI cannot directly access your files; you must provide data in your prompts.

12. **False** - Pie charts become difficult to read with many categories; bar charts work better for 6+ categories.

13. **True** - Complex formulas should be tested with known data before deployment.

14. **True** - AI can synthesize multiple sources if you provide the content in your prompt.

15. **False** - Outliers should be investigated, not automatically removed; they often reveal important insights.

### Section 3: Scenario-Based

16. **B** - Verify the calculation and check for data anomalies
    - *Explanation: A 150% increase is unusual and warrants verification before sharing.*

17. **C** - Pie or donut chart
    - *Explanation: Part-of-whole comparisons with few categories work well as pie/donut charts.*

18. **B** - The lookup value doesn't exist in the reference table
    - *Explanation: #N/A in VLOOKUP typically means the lookup value wasn't found; FALSE requires exact match.*

19. **B** - Describe the dataset structure and provide summary statistics
    - *Explanation: For large datasets, describe the structure and provide relevant summaries for AI to work with.*

20. **B** - Stock price alone doesn't indicate competitive failure; more context needed
    - *Explanation: Jumping to conclusions from limited data is poor analysis; multiple factors should be considered.*
