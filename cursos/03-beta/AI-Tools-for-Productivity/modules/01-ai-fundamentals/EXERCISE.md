## Part 3: Exploring Limitations (25 minutes)

### Task 3.1: Testing for Hallucinations

**Important**: This exercise demonstrates AI limitations. Don't use AI-generated "facts" in real work without verification.

**Prompt to use:**
```
What awards did the book "Optimizing Team Performance Through AI Integration"
win, and who is its author?
```

**Expected result**: The AI may confidently describe a book that doesn't exist.

**Record:**
- What response did you receive?
- How confident did the AI sound?
- Did either tool acknowledge uncertainty?
- What does this teach you about fact-checking?

### Task 3.2: Testing Knowledge Limits

**Prompt to use:**
```
What significant AI product launches happened in the last 30 days?
```

**Assessment:**
- Did the AI acknowledge its knowledge cutoff?
- How did each tool handle the request?
- What strategies did they suggest for getting current information?

### Task 3.3: Consistency Test

Send this prompt to one tool THREE times (start new conversations each time):

```
Generate 3 creative names for a productivity app focused on busy executives.
```

**Record all three responses:**

Response 1:
```
[Names here]
```

Response 2:
```
[Names here]
```

Response 3:
```
[Names here]
```

**Analysis:**
- Were responses identical or different?
- What does this tell you about AI reproducibility?
- How might this affect your work?

## Part 4: Ethics Scenario Analysis (15 minutes)

### Task 4.1: Scenario Evaluation

For each scenario, decide if AI use is appropriate and explain your reasoning.

**Scenario A: Email Response**
Your manager asks you to respond to a customer complaint. You want to use AI to draft the response.

- Appropriate? Yes / No / It Depends
- Reasoning:
- What precautions would you take?

**Scenario B: Performance Review Input**
You need to write self-evaluation content for your annual review.

- Appropriate? Yes / No / It Depends
- Reasoning:
- What precautions would you take?

**Scenario C: Competitive Analysis**
You want to use AI to analyze a competitor's publicly available marketing materials.

**I will use AI for:**
1.
2.
3.

**I will not use AI for:**
1.
2.
3.

## Tips for Success

- **Be honest** in your assessments - the goal is learning, not perfect results
- **Try variations** - if a prompt doesn't work well, experiment
- **Take notes** - capture insights for future reference
- **Think critically** - question AI outputs, don't accept them blindly
- **Connect to your work** - the more relevant your examples, the more valuable the learning

## Common Issues and Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| AI gives very long responses | Add "Keep response under X words" to prompt |
| AI doesn't follow format | Be more specific: "Format as a numbered list of exactly 5 items" |
| Responses feel generic | Add context about your role, industry, or specific situation |
| Tool seems slow | Try a different time of day; free tiers may have usage limits |
| Can't think of real tasks | Use the suggested tasks or ask the AI for suggestions |
