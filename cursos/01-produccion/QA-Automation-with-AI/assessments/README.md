### Common Questions

**Q: How much AI usage is enough?**
A: Every assignment should demonstrate AI usage. Focus on effective prompting, not quantity. Quality over quantity.

**Q: What if AI generates incorrect code?**
A: Document the issue, explain how you identified it, and show your fix. This demonstrates critical thinking!

**Q: Can I use AI for quizzes?**
A: No. Quizzes assess YOUR understanding, not AI's capabilities.

**Q: What if I'm stuck on an exercise?**
A: Try different AI prompts, consult documentation, ask in Slack, attend office hours.

**Q: Do I need to show ALL my AI interactions?**
A: No, show highlights - key prompts, interesting iterations, important lessons learned.
