# Course Focus Correction Notice

## Date: November 2025

---

## ⚠️ Important Update

This repository underwent a correction in November 2025 to properly reflect the primary course focus.

---

## What Changed?

### Before (November 2024)
- **Marked as Primary:** MentorMate-QA-Automation (3 modules)
- **Marked as "Moved":** QA-Automation-with-AI (12 modules)
- **Direction:** Content from QA-Automation-with-AI was being "merged into" MentorMate

### After (November 2025) ✅
- **PRIMARY COURSE:** QA-Automation-with-AI (12 complete modules)
- **ALTERNATIVE FORMAT:** MentorMate-QA-Automation (3 modules, 4-week intensive)
- **Direction:** Both courses coexist, QA-Automation-with-AI is the main offering

---

## Why the Change?

### The Issue
The November 2024 merge incorrectly positioned MentorMate-QA-Automation as the primary course, when in fact:
- QA-Automation-with-AI has **12 complete modules** vs. MentorMate's 3 modules
- QA-Automation-with-AI is the **comprehensive, AI-first** curriculum
- QA-Automation-with-AI has more content: 826KB vs. 633KB
- QA-Automation-with-AI includes 9 professional presentation templates
- QA-Automation-with-AI has complete exercises and quizzes for all 12 modules

### The Correction
We've now properly recognized QA-Automation-with-AI as the **primary** course offering, with MentorMate serving as an **alternative format** (traditional 4-week intensive) for those who prefer that structure.
