# Module 11: Advanced Testing Strategies
## AI-Enhanced Testing, Security & Cross-Platform Automation

---

## Module Overview

This module covers advanced testing strategies that go beyond basic test automation, incorporating AI-assisted approaches, security testing, visual regression, accessibility testing, and cross-platform compatibility. Students will learn enterprise-grade testing patterns used in modern QA automation labs.

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

1. Implement visual regression testing with Playwright
2. Perform accessibility (a11y) testing and WCAG compliance checks
3. Execute cross-browser and cross-platform testing strategies
4. Integrate basic security scanning into test workflows
5. Handle test flakiness and improve test stability
6. Optimize test suite performance and parallel execution
7. Generate comprehensive test reports and analytics
8. Use AI tools for test generation and debugging

## Key Concepts

### Visual Regression Testing
Automatically detect unintended visual changes in your application by comparing screenshots against approved baselines.

### Accessibility Testing
Ensure your application is usable by people with disabilities by testing against WCAG guidelines.

### Cross-Platform Testing
Verify your application works correctly across different browsers, devices, and operating systems.

### Security Testing
Identify vulnerabilities in authentication, authorization, and data handling.

### Test Stability
Create reliable, repeatable tests that don't fail randomly due to timing or environmental issues.
