## Common Issues & Solutions

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| All content sounds the same | Use different prompt structures; vary the "role" |
| Can't find unique angle | Research competitors first; ask AI "what's missing from existing content on this topic" |
| Email sequence feels disconnected | Add references to previous emails; maintain consistent throughline |
| Social posts too long | Specify word limits in prompt; edit ruthlessly |
| Brand voice inconsistent | Create a voice calibration prompt; use at start of each session |

## Example: Before/After Social Post

**AI Generated (Before):**
```
In today's competitive business landscape, marketing teams
are constantly seeking ways to improve their efficiency.
AI tools have emerged as valuable resources for content
creation. Here are some ways AI can help your marketing:

1. Generate ideas faster
2. Create content at scale
3. Optimize for SEO

```

**Edited (After):**
```
Our blog took 4 hours to write.

Now it takes 45 minutes.

Here's the exact workflow we use (no magic, just method):

We don't ask AI to "write a blog post."

We ask it to:
→ Generate 3 angle options (we pick)
→ Create an outline (we refine)
→ Draft section by section (we edit heavily)

The AI writes ~60%. We add the other 40%: our data,
our examples, our opinions.

That 40% is what makes it ours.

What's your AI content ratio?

```

**What Changed:**
- Generic opening → Specific result
- Vague list → Concrete process
- Generic CTA → Specific question
- Corporate voice → Conversational
