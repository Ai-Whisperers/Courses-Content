## Variation 1: Problem-Focused

### Final Version (Edited):

**Headline:** Your Content Team Can't Keep Up

**Primary Text:** Small teams. Enterprise expectations. The math doesn't work. Unless you change how you create content.

**CTA:** Get the Free Toolkit

**Changes:**
- Softened "burning out" (too dramatic for cold audience)
- Made primary text more rhythmic and punchy
- CTA emphasizes "free"
