```

**AI Response:**
```
[Paste response]
```

**Your Verification:**
- Paper 1: Real? Y / N / Unable to verify

**What Did You Learn?**

### Task 2.2: Confidence vs. Accuracy Test

**Ask AI about something specific:**
```
Prompt: What was the exact revenue of [a company you know the actual answer for] in their most recent fiscal year?
```

**AI Response:**
```
[Paste response]
```

**Actual Answer:** _______________

**Assessment:**

- What does this demonstrate about AI confidence?

### Task 2.3: Consistency Test

Ask the same factual question in two separate conversations:

**Question:** _______________

**Response 1:**
```
[First conversation response]
```

**Response 2:**
```
[Second conversation response]
```

**Analysis:**
- Were responses consistent? Yes / No
- What differed?
- What does this tell you about reliability?

## Part 3: Professional Judgment Scenarios (20 minutes)

### Task 3.1: AI Role Assessment

For each task, determine if AI should be used and what role human judgment plays:

| Task | Use AI? | AI Role | Human Role | Why |
|------|---------|---------|------------|-----|
| Writing performance review | | | | |
| Recommending employee for promotion | | | | |
| Drafting company policy | | | | |
| Creating training materials | | | | |
| Deciding budget allocation | | | | |
| Writing termination letter | | | | |

### Task 3.2: Judgment Override Scenario

**Scenario:** AI suggests a particular approach for a client communication, but your experience tells you this approach might not work well with this specific client.

**AI Suggestion:**
```
Based on standard best practices, I recommend a formal, detailed proposal
with comprehensive documentation of all terms and conditions.
```

**Your Context:** This client prefers brief, direct communication and gets frustrated with lengthy documents. They've mentioned this multiple times.

**Your Decision:**
- Follow AI recommendation: Yes / No
- Your approach:
- Reasoning:

**Key Principle Demonstrated:**

## Part 4: Data Privacy Assessment (20 minutes)

### Task 4.1: Data Classification Exercise

Classify each data type and determine if it can be input to AI:

| Data | Classification | Safe for AI? | Why |
|------|---------------|--------------|-----|
| Company's public press release | | | |
| Customer names and emails | | | |
| Your personal meeting notes | | | |
| Quarterly financial results (pre-earnings) | | | |
| Employee performance scores | | | |
| Public competitor website content | | | |
| Internal salary bands | | | |
| Customer support ticket content | | | |

| Contract terms with a vendor | | | |

### Task 4.2: Data Minimization Practice

Take this scenario and create an anonymized version safe for AI:

**Original Data:**
```
We need to analyze why Acme Corporation (our largest client at $2.3M annual
contract) is considering switching to CompetitorX. Our account manager
Sarah Johnson had a call with their CFO Michael Chen on November 15th.
The main concerns were our response time (currently 48 hours average vs
their expectation of 24 hours) and the recent pricing increase of 15%
we implemented in Q3.
```

**Your Anonymized Version:**
```
[Write the anonymized version]
```

**What You Preserved:**
**What You Removed/Changed:**

### Task 4.3: Policy Compliance Scenario

**Scenario:** Your company's AI policy states:
- AI tools approved: ChatGPT, Claude (free tiers only)
- Prohibited data: Customer PII, financial data, HR records
- Required: Document AI use in project notes

You want to use AI to help write a project proposal that includes budget estimates and will be sent to an external client.
