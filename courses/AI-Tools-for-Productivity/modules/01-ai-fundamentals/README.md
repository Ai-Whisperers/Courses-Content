## 1. What AI Can and Cannot Do

### Understanding Modern AI Capabilities

Today's AI tools are built on Large Language Models (LLMs) - sophisticated systems trained on vast amounts of text data. Think of them as extremely well-read assistants who can write, analyze, and synthesize information quickly, but who lack true understanding or real-world experience.

### What AI Does Well

**Content Generation**
- Draft emails, reports, and documents quickly
- Create outlines and brainstorm ideas
- Rewrite content for different audiences
- Summarize long documents

**Information Processing**
- Extract key points from lengthy text
- Organize and categorize information
- Compare multiple documents
- Identify patterns in text data

**Language Tasks**
- Proofread and edit writing
- Translate between languages
- Adjust tone and style
- Explain complex concepts simply

**Analysis Support**
- Break down problems into steps
- Generate questions to consider
- Provide multiple perspectives
- Create frameworks for decisions

### What AI Cannot Do Reliably

**Factual Accuracy**
- AI can confidently state incorrect information
- It cannot verify facts against real-world truth
- Recent events may not be in its training data
- Specific numbers, dates, and statistics require verification

**Original Research**
- Cannot access the internet in real-time (unless specifically enabled)
- Cannot run experiments or gather primary data
- Cannot interview people or conduct surveys
- Limited to patterns in training data

**Professional Judgment**
- Cannot understand your specific organizational context
- Cannot evaluate political dynamics or relationships
- Cannot make decisions requiring human accountability
- Cannot assess risk in nuanced situations

**Confidentiality Understanding**
- May use your inputs for training (check policies)
- Cannot truly "forget" sensitive information
- Cannot understand legal implications of disclosure
- Cannot assess what should remain confidential

> **Key Insight**: AI is a powerful assistant, not a replacement for professional judgment. Your role is to direct, verify, and refine AI outputs.

## 2. Choosing the Right AI Tool

### Major AI Assistants Compared

| Feature | ChatGPT (OpenAI) | Claude (Anthropic) | Microsoft Copilot |
|---------|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Best For** | General tasks, coding | Long documents, analysis | Microsoft 365 integration |
| **Free Tier** | Yes (GPT-3.5) | Yes (limited) | Yes (limited) |
| **Paid Tier** | $20/month (GPT-4) | $20/month (Pro) | Included in M365 |
| **Context Length** | 8K-128K tokens | 100K-200K tokens | Varies |
| **Strengths** | Versatile, plugins | Thoughtful, safe | Office integration |
| **Integration** | API, web, mobile | API, web | Microsoft ecosystem |

### When to Use Each Tool

**Choose ChatGPT when:**
- You need quick, general-purpose assistance
- Working with code or technical content
- Want access to plugins and web browsing
- Need image generation (DALL-E)

**Choose Claude when:**
- Working with very long documents

### Tool Selection Framework

Ask yourself:
1. **What's the task?** - Content creation, analysis, coding, or integration
2. **How long is the input?** - Short prompt vs. long document
3. **What's the sensitivity?** - Public info vs. confidential data
4. **What tools do I have?** - Existing licenses and access

---

## 3. Understanding AI Limitations

### The Hallucination Problem

AI can generate plausible-sounding but completely false information. This happens because:

- AI predicts likely next words, not truth
- Training data contains errors and contradictions
- AI aims to be helpful, sometimes at the cost of accuracy
- Confidence in output doesn't correlate with correctness

**Example of Hallucination:**
```
Prompt: "Who wrote the book 'The Productivity Paradox'?"
AI might respond: "The Productivity Paradox was written by Dr. Sarah Mitchell
in 2019, exploring how technology often decreases rather than increases
workplace efficiency."

Reality: This book and author may not exist. The AI constructed a
plausible-sounding answer.
```

### Knowledge Cutoff Dates

Each AI model has a training cutoff date - it doesn't know about events after that point.

| Model | Approximate Cutoff |
|-------|-------------------|
| GPT-4 | April 2023 |
| Claude 3 | Early 2024 |
| Copilot | Recent (web access) |

**Implications:**
- Recent company news won't be known
- New products, policies, or events are absent
- Industry trends may be outdated
- Always verify time-sensitive information

### Context Window Limitations

AI can only process a limited amount of text at once (the "context window"):

- Too much input causes important details to be missed
- Very long conversations may "forget" early context
- Complex multi-part tasks may lose coherence
- Strategy: Break large tasks into smaller chunks

### Consistency Challenges

AI may give different answers to the same question:
- Responses have inherent randomness
- Slight prompt changes produce different outputs
- Cannot guarantee reproducible results
- Solution: Use specific prompts and verify important outputs

---

## 4. Ethics and Appropriate Use

### Professional Ethics Framework

**Transparency**
- Disclose AI assistance when appropriate
- Don't claim AI work as original human work
- Be honest about how content was created
- Follow company disclosure policies

**Accountability**
- You are responsible for AI outputs you use
- Review everything before sharing
- Don't blame AI for your mistakes
- Maintain professional standards

**Privacy**
- Don't input confidential customer data
- Avoid personal information in prompts
- Check your company's AI data policies
- Consider what AI providers do with inputs

**Fairness**
- Watch for bias in AI outputs
- Don't use AI to discriminate
- Verify AI doesn't perpetuate stereotypes
- Apply human judgment to sensitive topics

### Company Policy Considerations

Before using AI at work, understand:

1. **Approved Tools**: Which AI tools are sanctioned?
2. **Data Restrictions**: What can/cannot be input?
3. **Disclosure Requirements**: When must AI use be disclosed?
4. **Review Processes**: What approval is needed?
5. **Industry Regulations**: Are there compliance concerns?

### Use Case Appropriateness Matrix

| Use Case | Generally OK | Use with Caution | Avoid |
|----------|-------------|------------------|-------|
| Draft emails | Internal routine | Client-facing | Legal/HR sensitive |
| Summarize docs | Public documents | Internal reports | Confidential contracts |
| Create presentations | General topics | Financial data | Board materials |
| Data analysis | Public data | Aggregated internal | Individual PII |
| Research | Market research | Competitive intel | Due diligence |
