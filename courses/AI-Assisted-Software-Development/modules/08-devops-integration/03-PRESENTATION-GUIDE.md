### Part 3: Lessons Learned (3 minutes)

**Structure your reflection:**

#### What Worked Well (1 min)
- Most effective AI usage
- Productivity gains
- Quality improvements
- Favorite technique

**Example:**
> "GitHub Copilot was incredibly helpful for test generation. I generated 80% of my test cases with AI, which I then refined for edge cases. This saved me about an hour."

#### Challenges Faced (1 min)
- Where AI struggled
- Problems you solved
- Time-consuming aspects
- What required manual work

**Example:**
> "AI-generated authentication code needed significant security review. The initial suggestions used outdated patterns, so I had to research current best practices and modify the code."

#### Key Takeaways (1 min)
- Most important learning
- What you'd do differently
- Advice for others
- How you'll apply this

**Example:**
> "My main takeaway is that AI is best as an accelerator, not a replacement. The time saved on boilerplate let me focus on business logic and security. Next time, I'd start with AI-assisted architecture planning earlier."

---

### Part 4: Q&A (2 minutes)

#### Anticipated Questions

**Technical:**
- "Why did you choose [technology]?"
- "How does [feature] work?"
- "What's your test coverage?"
- "How did you handle [security concern]?"

**AI-Related:**
- "What was your AI acceptance rate?"
- "Which AI tool was most helpful?"
- "Did AI make any significant mistakes?"
- "How much time did AI save?"

**Process:**
- "What was your biggest challenge?"
- "What would you do differently?"
- "How did you ensure code quality?"

#### Answering Tips

```markdown
✅ Good Answer Structure:
1. Direct answer
2. Brief explanation
3. Example if helpful

Example:
Q: "What was your AI acceptance rate?"
A: "About 70%. I accepted most code completion suggestions
   but modified about 30% - mainly for error handling
   and edge cases that AI didn't anticipate."
```

## Common Presentation Mistakes

### Avoid These:

1. **Reading from slides**
   - Know your content
   - Slides are visual aids

2. **Demo without narration**
   - Explain what you're doing
   - Highlight important parts

3. **Too much code walkthrough**
   - Show working features
   - Don't read code line by line

4. **Rushing the reflection**
   - This shows learning
   - Take time for insights

5. **Apologizing excessively**
   - Small issues happen
   - Stay professional

6. **Going over time**
   - Practice timing
   - Have a shortened version ready

---

## Backup Plan

If demo fails:

1. **Stay calm**
   - "Let me show you screenshots instead"

2. **Use backup materials**
   - Prepared screenshots
   - Recorded demo video
   - Code walkthrough in editor

3. **Explain what should happen**
   - "This endpoint would return..."
   - "The test suite shows..."

4. **Focus on what works**
   - Shift to working features
   - Emphasize documentation
