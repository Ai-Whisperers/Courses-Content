## Key Takeaways

1. **Context Is Everything**
   - More context = better suggestions
   - Open relevant files
   - Write descriptive comments

2. **Comments Are Your Interface**
   - Write for Copilot, not just humans
   - Include types, examples, edge cases
   - Iterate on comment quality

3. **Chat for Complex Tasks**
   - Use Chat for multi-step work
   - /explain to understand code
   - /fix for debugging assistance

4. **Review Every Suggestion**
   - AI isn't perfect
   - Understand before accepting
   - Test generated code

5. **Establish Patterns Early**
   - First example sets the pattern
   - Copilot follows established conventions
   - Consistency improves with usage

## Common Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Inconsistent Suggestions
**Solution:** Establish patterns in first file, keep relevant files open

### Challenge 2: Wrong Language/Framework
**Solution:** Add explicit framework mentions in comments

### Challenge 3: Outdated API Suggestions
**Solution:** Use Chat to verify, check documentation

### Challenge 4: Too Many Tab Presses
**Solution:** Accept word-by-word with Ctrl+Right arrow
