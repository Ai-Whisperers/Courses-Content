## Security Considerations

### What NOT to Include in AI Prompts
```
❌ API keys and secrets
❌ Database credentials
❌ Personal user data
❌ Proprietary algorithms
❌ Internal system details
❌ Customer information
❌ Security configurations
```

### Safe Prompting Practices
```
✅ Use placeholder values
✅ Abstract sensitive patterns
✅ Generalize specific details
✅ Use public examples
✅ Review before sending
```

## Quality Gates for AI Code

### Mandatory Review Checklist

1. **Security Review**
   - No hardcoded secrets
   - Input validation present
   - Output encoding applied
   - Authentication checked

2. **Quality Review**
   - Follows project conventions
   - Includes error handling
   - Has appropriate logging
   - Meets performance requirements

3. **Testing Requirements**
   - Unit tests included
   - Edge cases covered
   - Integration points tested

## Productivity Measurement

### Metrics to Track
- Lines of code generated vs. kept
- Time to complete features
- Bug rate in AI-assisted code
- Code review feedback
- Developer satisfaction

### What NOT to Measure
- Raw AI usage volume
- Acceptance rate without quality
- Speed without correctness

## Key Takeaways

1. **Security First**
   - Never include secrets in prompts
   - Always review generated code
   - Scan for vulnerabilities

2. **Quality Over Speed**
   - AI code needs same review
   - Test thoroughly
   - Maintain standards

3. **Clear Policies**
   - Document what's allowed
   - Train team members
   - Regular policy review

4. **Measure Thoughtfully**
   - Quality metrics over quantity
   - Developer experience matters
   - Iterate on approach
