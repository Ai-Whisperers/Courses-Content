## AI-Assisted Software Development Course

Key terms and definitions for AI-assisted development.

---

## A

### AI Code Completion
Automatic suggestion of code snippets, functions, or entire blocks based on context. Examples: GitHub Copilot, Tabnine.

### AI Hallucination
When an AI model generates plausible-sounding but incorrect or fabricated information. Critical to verify AI outputs.

### API (Application Programming Interface)
A set of protocols and tools for building software applications. AI tools often provide APIs for programmatic access.

### Agentic AI
AI systems that can autonomously perform tasks, make decisions, and take actions with minimal human intervention.

---

## B

### Boilerplate Code
Repetitive, standardized code that can be reused with minimal modification. AI excels at generating boilerplate.

### Benchmark
A standard test used to measure AI model performance on specific tasks like code generation or completion.

---

## C

### Chain of Thought (CoT)
Prompting technique where AI shows reasoning steps, improving accuracy on complex problems.

### Code Review
Process of examining code for bugs, security issues, and quality. AI can assist but not replace human review.

### Context Window
The amount of text/code an AI model can consider at once. Larger windows enable better understanding.

### Copilot
GitHub's AI pair programming tool that suggests code in real-time within IDEs.

---

## D

### Deterministic
Producing the same output for the same input. AI models are often non-deterministic (different outputs each time).

### Documentation Generation
Using AI to automatically create code documentation, comments, READMEs, and API docs.

---

## E

### Edge Case
Unusual or extreme input that may cause unexpected behavior. Good testing covers edge cases.

### Embedding
Vector representation of text/code used by AI models to understand semantic meaning.

---

## F

### Few-Shot Learning
Providing AI with a few examples to improve output quality. Contrast with zero-shot (no examples).

### Fine-Tuning
Customizing a pre-trained AI model on specific data to improve performance for particular tasks.

---

## G

### Ghost Text
Semi-transparent code suggestions shown inline by Copilot before acceptance.

### Ground Truth
The correct answer used to evaluate AI model accuracy.

---

## H

### Hallucination
See AI Hallucination.

### Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)
System design where humans review and validate AI outputs before use.

---

## I

### IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
Software application providing tools for software development. Examples: VS Code, IntelliJ, PyCharm.

### Inference
The process of AI models generating outputs from inputs. Faster inference = quicker suggestions.

### Inline Suggestion
Code suggestions appearing directly in the editor at cursor position.

---

## J

### JSDoc
Documentation format for JavaScript using special comment blocks (`/** */`).

---

## L

### LLM (Large Language Model)
AI models trained on vast text datasets, capable of understanding and generating human-like text and code. Examples: GPT-4, Claude, Llama.

### Latency
Time delay between request and response. Important for real-time code completion.

---

## M

### Model
The trained AI system that generates outputs. Different models have different capabilities.

### Multi-Modal
AI models that process multiple input types (text, images, code).

---

## N

### Natural Language Processing (NLP)
AI field focused on understanding and generating human language.

---

## O

### OWASP Top 10
List of most critical web application security risks. AI can help identify these vulnerabilities.

### Overfitting
When AI performs well on training data but poorly on new data. Leads to irrelevant suggestions.

---

## P

### Parameter
1. In AI: Values learned during training that determine model behavior
2. In code: Variables passed to functions

### Prompt
The input text/code given to an AI model to generate a response.

### Prompt Engineering
The art of crafting effective prompts to get optimal AI outputs.

---

## R

### RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
Technique combining AI generation with document retrieval for more accurate, grounded responses.

### Refactoring
Restructuring code without changing behavior. AI can suggest refactoring opportunities.

### Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)
Training technique using human preferences to improve AI outputs.

---

## S

### Semantic Understanding
AI's ability to understand meaning, not just syntax. Enables context-aware suggestions.

### Static Analysis
Examining code without running it. AI can perform sophisticated static analysis.

### Suggestions
Code recommendations provided by AI tools.

---

## T

### Temperature
Parameter controlling AI output randomness. Lower = more deterministic, higher = more creative.

### Token
Basic unit of text processing in LLMs. Roughly 4 characters or 0.75 words.

### Training Data
The code and text used to train AI models. Affects what the model "knows."

---

## U

### Unit Test
Test for individual code units (functions, methods). AI can generate unit tests automatically.

---

## V

### Validation
1. Checking if AI output is correct and useful
2. Verifying input data meets requirements

### Vector Database
Database optimized for storing and searching embeddings. Used in RAG systems.

---

## Z

### Zero-Shot
AI performing a task without specific examples, relying only on general knowledge.
