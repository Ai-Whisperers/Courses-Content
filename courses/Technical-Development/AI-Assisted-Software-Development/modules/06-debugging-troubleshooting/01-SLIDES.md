## Slide 1: Title

# AI for Architecture

**Module 6 of 8**

*Design Smarter Systems with AI Guidance*

---

## Slide 2: Objectives

# What You'll Learn

1. Use AI for system design
2. Evaluate technology options
3. Plan refactoring strategies
4. Apply design patterns
5. Assess technical debt

---

## Slide 3: AI Architecture Capabilities

# What AI Can Do for Architecture

### Strong
- Technology comparisons
- Pattern identification
- Best practice guidance
- Documentation generation
- Code structure analysis

### Limited
- Business-specific decisions
- Team dynamics
- Budget constraints
- Organizational politics

---

## Slide 4: System Design with AI

# System Design Process

### Step 1: Define Requirements
```
Build a real-time messaging system for 100K users.

Requirements:
- Real-time message delivery
- Message history
- User presence
- Group chats
- File sharing
```

### Step 2: Ask AI for Design
```
Design a scalable architecture for this system.
Include components, data flow, and technology stack.
```

---

## Slide 5: Architecture Prompt Template

# Effective Architecture Prompts

```
Design a [system type] architecture.

Requirements:
- [Functional requirements]
- [Non-functional requirements]

Constraints:
- [Team size/skills]
- [Budget]
- [Timeline]
- [Existing infrastructure]

Provide:
- Component diagram (ASCII)
- Technology recommendations
- Data flow description
- Scalability approach
- Trade-offs considered
```

---

## Slide 6: Technology Selection

# AI-Assisted Tech Evaluation

### Prompt
```
Compare PostgreSQL vs MongoDB vs CassandraDB for:
- E-commerce platform
- 10M products
- 1M daily orders
- Read-heavy workload

Include pros/cons table and recommendation.
```

### AI Provides
- Feature comparison
- Performance characteristics
- Scalability considerations
- Cost analysis
- Final recommendation

---

## Slide 7: Refactoring Strategies

# Planning Refactors with AI

```
We have a 50K line monolithic Node.js app.
We want to migrate to microservices.

Current structure: [describe]
Pain points: [list]
Team: 5 developers

Create a migration plan:
- Phase breakdown
- Service boundaries
- Risk mitigation
- Testing strategy
```

---

## Slide 8: Design Pattern Guidance

# Identifying Patterns

```
Here's my code:

[paste code]

What design patterns could improve this?
Explain why and show implementation.
```

### Common AI Suggestions
- Factory for object creation
- Strategy for algorithms
- Observer for events
- Repository for data access

---

## Slide 9: Technical Debt Assessment

# AI Debt Analysis

```
Analyze this codebase for technical debt:

[paste code or describe structure]

Identify:
- Code smells
- Architecture issues
- Outdated dependencies
- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance bottlenecks

Prioritize fixes by impact/effort.
```

---

## Slide 10: Validation is Critical

# Always Validate AI Architecture Advice

### AI Doesn't Know
- Your team's expertise
- Internal politics
- Exact budget
- Historical context
- Specific integrations

### You Must
- Review with senior engineers
- Consider practical constraints
- Pilot before committing
- Document decisions

---

## Slide 11: Live Demo

# Demo: Design a System

### Scenario
Design architecture for a ride-sharing app.

### We'll Use AI To
1. Generate initial architecture
2. Compare database options
3. Identify potential issues
4. Create ADR

---

## Slide 12: Best Practices

# Architecture Best Practices

✅ Use AI for initial ideas
✅ Provide detailed context
✅ Ask for trade-offs
✅ Request alternatives
✅ Document with ADRs
✅ Validate with team

❌ Accept blindly
❌ Skip human review
❌ Ignore constraints
❌ Over-engineer early

---

## Slide 13: Module Summary

# Module 6 Summary

### Covered
✅ System design with AI
✅ Technology evaluation
✅ Refactoring planning
✅ Design patterns
✅ Technical debt

### Key Skill
Use AI as architecture advisor, not decision-maker.

---

## Slide 14: Next Module

# Up Next: Security & Best Practices

**Module 7 Preview:**
- Security in AI code
- IP and confidentiality
- Quality control
- Productivity measurement
