# Workshop Facilitation Guide
## AI-Assisted Software Development Course

---

## Overview

This guide provides facilitators with strategies for running effective workshops during the 16-hour course.

## Workshop Philosophy

### Principles

1. **Learn by Doing** - Maximize hands-on time
2. **Safe to Fail** - Create low-stakes practice environment
3. **Peer Learning** - Encourage collaboration
4. **Real-World Focus** - Use practical, applicable examples

### Time Allocation

| Activity Type | % of Workshop Time |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Instruction | 30% |
| Hands-on Practice | 50% |
| Discussion & Review | 20% |

## Room Setup

### Physical Space
- Participants should see both their screen and main display
- Room for movement during exercises
- Visible timer/clock
- Whiteboard for diagrams

### Technical Requirements
- Stable internet connection
- Each participant has:
  - VS Code with Copilot
  - Access to Claude/ChatGPT
  - Node.js installed
  - Git configured

## Facilitation Techniques

### Opening Each Module

```markdown
1. Hook (2 min)
   - Compelling question or scenario
   - Connect to real problems

2. Objectives (1 min)
   - What they'll learn
   - What they'll be able to do

3. Context (2 min)
   - Why this matters
   - How it connects to previous learning
```

### During Exercises

**DO:**
- Circulate the room
- Ask guiding questions
- Celebrate progress
- Note common struggles

**DON'T:**
- Solve problems for them
- Rush participants
- Compare speeds
- Ignore struggling participants

### Closing Each Module

```markdown
1. Summary (3 min)
   - Key takeaways
   - Connections made

2. Q&A (5 min)
   - Address questions
   - Clarify confusion

3. Preview (1 min)
   - What's next
   - How it builds on this
```

## Common Challenges and Solutions

### Technical Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Copilot not working | Check authentication, have backup prompts ready |
| Slow internet | Use offline examples, pre-downloaded content |
| AI rate limits | Rotate between tools, have screenshots |
| Environment issues | Docker backup, cloud IDE option |

### Participant Challenges

| Challenge | Approach |
|-----------|----------|
| Moving too fast | Pair with faster participant, offer simplified version |
| Moving too slow | Provide extra challenges, encourage to help others |
| Distracted | Engage directly, assign specific role |
| Skeptical | Acknowledge concerns, show concrete benefits |
| Over-reliant on AI | Ask to explain code, verify understanding |

## Exercise Facilitation

### Before Exercise

```markdown
1. Explain clearly
   - What they're doing
   - What success looks like
   - Time available

2. Demo briefly
   - Show first step
   - Don't over-demonstrate

3. Check understanding
   - "Any questions before starting?"
   - "Everyone clear on the goal?"
```

### During Exercise

```markdown
1. Set timer
   - Visible to all
   - Give time warnings

2. Monitor progress
   - Walk around
   - Check screens
   - Note struggles

3. Provide support
   - Hints, not answers
   - "What have you tried?"
   - "What would happen if...?"

4. Manage pace
   - Fast: Add challenge
   - Slow: Offer help
```

### After Exercise

```markdown
1. Gather attention
   - Clear signal (sound, lights)
   - Wait for full attention

2. Debrief
   - What did you learn?
   - What was challenging?
   - What surprised you?

3. Share solutions
   - Multiple approaches
   - Highlight creativity
   - Address common issues
```

## Discussion Facilitation

### Effective Questions

**Open-ended:**
- "How might you apply this in your work?"
- "What concerns do you have about this approach?"
- "What would you need to feel confident using this?"

**Specific:**
- "What was the most effective prompt you wrote?"
- "Where did AI suggestions need the most modification?"
- "What security concerns did you notice?"

### Managing Discussion

- **Encourage quiet participants:** "Sarah, what's your perspective?"
- **Redirect off-topic:** "Interesting point. Let's capture that for later."
- **Handle dominant voices:** "Thanks John. Let's hear from others."
- **Build on contributions:** "Building on what Alex said..."
