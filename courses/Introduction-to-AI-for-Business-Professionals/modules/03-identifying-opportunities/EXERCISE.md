## Part 1: PAIN Framework Application (25 minutes)

### Task 1.1: Process Inefficiency (P)

List processes in your organization that show inefficiency signals.

| Process | Volume (per day/week) | Current Time Per Task | Pain Points |
|---------|----------------------|----------------------|-------------|
| Example: Invoice processing | 50/day | 15 min each | Manual data entry, errors |
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |

### Task 1.2: Analysis Needs (A)

Identify where your organization needs better analysis.

| Question We Can't Answer | Data That Might Help | Business Impact |
|-------------------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Example: "Why are customers leaving?" | Purchase history, support tickets | 10% churn = $500K lost |
| | | |
| | | |
| | | |
| | | |

### Task 1.3: Information Overload (I)

Find areas where there's too much information to process.

| Information Type | Volume | Current Approach | What's Missed |
|-----------------|--------|-----------------|---------------|
| Example: Customer feedback | 1,000/month | Read sample of 100 | 90% unreviewed |
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |

### Task 1.4: Natural Language Tasks (N)

Identify language-intensive work.

| Task | Volume | Time Spent | Current Challenges |
|------|--------|-----------|-------------------|
| Example: Customer email responses | 200/day | 5 min each | Consistency, speed |
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |

## Part 4: VALUE Prioritization (25 minutes)

### Task 4.1: Score All Opportunities

Use the VALUE framework to score your opportunities.

| Opportunity | V (Value) 1-5 | A (Achievable) 1-5 | L (Leadership) 1-5 | U (Urgency) 1-5 | E (Enablement) 1-5 | Total |
|-------------|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------------|-------|
| 1. | | | | | | |
| 2. | | | | | | |
| 3. | | | | | | |
| 4. | | | | | | |
| 5. | | | | | | |

**Scoring Guide:**
- V (Value): 1=$0-50K, 2=$50-100K, 3=$100-200K, 4=$200-500K, 5=$500K+
- A (Achievable): 1=Very complex, 3=Moderate, 5=Off-the-shelf exists
- L (Leadership): 1=No support, 3=Neutral, 5=Active champion
- U (Urgency): 1=Nice-to-have, 3=Helpful, 5=Critical/competitive
- E (Enablement): 1=No data, 3=Data needs work, 5=Data ready

### Task 4.2: Plot on Priority Matrix

Place your opportunities on the matrix:

```
                    HIGH FEASIBILITY (A+E > 7)
                          │
                    1     │     2
        QUICK WINS        │        STRATEGIC
                          │
                          │
LOW VALUE ─────────────────┼───────────────── HIGH VALUE
(V+U < 6)                 │                    (V+U > 6)
                    3     │     4
        DEPRIORITIZE      │        CHALLENGING
                          │
                    LOW FEASIBILITY (A+E < 6)
