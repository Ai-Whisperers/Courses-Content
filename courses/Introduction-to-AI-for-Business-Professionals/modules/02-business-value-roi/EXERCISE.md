For each value type, identify potential AI opportunities in your organization.

**Efficiency Value (Time/Cost Savings)**

| Process | Current State | AI Potential | Estimated Savings |
|---------|--------------|--------------|-------------------|
| Example: Invoice processing | 30 min/invoice | 5 min/invoice | 83% time reduction |
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |

**Revenue Value (Sales/Growth)**

| Opportunity | Current State | AI Potential | Estimated Impact |
|-------------|--------------|--------------|------------------|

## Part 2: ROI Calculation Practice (30 minutes)

### Task 2.1: Calculate ROI for Scenario A

**Scenario: AI-Powered Email Response System**

Your customer service team receives 500 emails daily. Currently:
- Average response time: 4 hours
- Time to compose response: 15 minutes
- Agent hourly cost: $25

An AI email assistant could:
- Draft responses for 60% of emails
- Reduce composition time to 3 minutes
- Cost: $500/month + $15,000 implementation

**Calculate:**

**Value Calculation:**
| Metric | Calculation | Result |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Emails AI can help with daily | 500 × 60% | = |
| Time saved per email | 15 min - 3 min = 12 min | = |
| Daily time saved (minutes) | ____ emails × 12 min | = |
| Daily time saved (hours) | ____ min ÷ 60 | = |
| Daily cost savings | ____ hours × $25 | = |
| Annual cost savings | ____ × 260 work days | = $ |

**Cost Calculation:**
| Cost Type | Year 1 |
|-----------|--------|
| Implementation | $15,000 |
| Annual subscription | $6,000 |
| Training (estimate) | $2,000 |
| **Total Year 1** | $ |
| **Annual ongoing (Year 2+)** | $ |

**ROI Calculation:**
- Year 1 ROI = (Annual Value - Year 1 Cost) ÷ Year 1 Cost × 100% = _____%
- Year 3 Total Value = Annual Value × 3 = $_____
- Year 3 Total Cost = Year 1 + (Year 2 × 2) = $_____
- Year 3 ROI = (Year 3 Value - Year 3 Cost) ÷ Year 3 Cost × 100% = _____%

**Payback Period:**
- Year 1 Cost ÷ Monthly Savings = _____ months

### Task 2.2: Calculate ROI for Scenario B

**Scenario: AI Sales Lead Scoring**

Your sales team has:
- 1,000 leads per month
- 10 salespeople
- Current conversion rate: 5%
- Average deal value: $10,000
- Sales time spent on unqualified leads: 30%

AI lead scoring could:
- Improve conversion rate to 7% by focusing on best leads
- Reduce time on unqualified leads by 50%
- Cost: $2,000/month + $25,000 implementation

**Calculate:**

**Revenue Value:**
| Metric | Calculation | Result |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Current monthly conversions | 1,000 × 5% | = |
| Current monthly revenue | ____ × $10,000 | = $ |
| New monthly conversions | 1,000 × 7% | = |
| New monthly revenue | ____ × $10,000 | = $ |
| Monthly revenue increase | New - Current | = $ |
| Annual revenue increase | × 12 | = $ |

**Efficiency Value:**
| Metric | Calculation | Result |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Time saved on unqualified leads | 30% × 50% reduction | = 15% |
| Salespeople effective hours added | 10 × 2,000 hrs/yr × 15% | = |
| Value of time (assume $75/hr) | ____ hours × $75 | = $ |

**Total Annual Value:**
- Revenue increase + Efficiency value = $_____

**Cost Calculation:**
| Cost Type | Year 1 | Annual |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Implementation | $25,000 | |
| Subscription | | $24,000 |
| Training | $5,000 | |
| **Total** | $ | $ |

**ROI:**
- Year 1 ROI = _____%
- Year 3 ROI = _____%
- Payback Period = _____ months
