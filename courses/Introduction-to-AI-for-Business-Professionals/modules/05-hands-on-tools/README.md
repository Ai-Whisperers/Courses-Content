## 5. Basic Prompting Techniques

### The CRAFT Framework

Use CRAFT for better prompts:

```
C - Context: Background information
R - Role: Who should the AI be
A - Action: What to do
F - Format: How to structure output
T - Tone: Style of response
```

**Example:**
```
Context: I'm a marketing manager at a B2B software company.
Role: Act as a marketing strategy consultant.
Action: Help me create messaging for a new product launch.
Format: Provide 3 options, each with headline, tagline, and key benefits.
Tone: Professional but engaging, avoid jargon.
```

### Be Specific

**Vague (Poor):**
```
Write about marketing.
```

**Specific (Better):**
```
Write a 200-word explanation of email marketing best practices
for small retail businesses, focusing on subject line optimization
and send timing.
```

### Provide Examples

**Without Example:**
```
Create a product description.
```

**With Example:**
```
Create a product description for our new project management software.

Here's an example of our brand voice:
"TeamSync helps you collaborate without the chaos. No more lost
emails, missed deadlines, or wondering who's doing what. Just
clear communication and projects that actually get done."

Match this style for our new product.
```

### Iterate and Refine

**First attempt → Not quite right → Refine:**

```
Prompt 1: "Write a sales email."
[Output too generic]

Prompt 2: "That's too generic. Make it more specific to CFOs
evaluating financial software. Include a concrete ROI example."
[Output better but too long]

Prompt 3: "Good points, but shorten to under 150 words.
Focus on the top benefit and one specific ROI example."
[Output is what you need]
```

### Common Prompt Patterns

**Ask for Options:**
```
Give me 5 different approaches to [problem].
For each, explain pros, cons, and when to use it.
```

**Request Specific Format:**
```
Respond in this format:
- Summary (2 sentences)
- Key points (bullet list)
- Recommendation (1 paragraph)
- Questions to consider (3-5 items)
```

**Set Constraints:**
```
[Your request]

Constraints:
- Maximum 200 words
- No technical jargon
- Include at least one specific example
- End with a question
```

## 6. Security and Privacy Best Practices

### What NOT to Share with AI

**Never Put These in AI Tools:**

```
❌ Passwords and credentials
❌ Personal identifiable information (PII) of customers/employees
❌ Financial account numbers
❌ Social Security numbers
❌ Medical records
❌ Confidential business strategy
❌ Unreleased financial information
❌ Trade secrets
❌ Legal privileged communications
❌ Sensitive M&A details
```

### Safe Practices

**DO:**
- Use generic examples instead of real customer data
- Anonymize information before pasting
- Check your company's AI usage policy
- Use enterprise AI solutions for sensitive work
- Log out when finished on shared computers

**DON'T:**
- Copy-paste customer databases
- Include real names/emails in prompts
- Share proprietary code or algorithms
- Discuss unannounced products in detail
- Trust AI outputs without verification

### Verification Best Practices

**Always Verify:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│           AI OUTPUT VERIFICATION CHECKLIST                  │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ □ Factual claims checked against reliable sources           │
│ □ Statistics and numbers verified                           │
│ □ Citations confirmed to exist                              │
│ □ Tone appropriate for audience                             │
│ □ No sensitive information accidentally included            │
│ □ Brand voice and style consistent                          │
│ □ Accurate representation of company policies               │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Company Policy Considerations

**Questions to Ask:**
1. Does my company have an AI usage policy?
2. Which AI tools are approved for use?
3. What data can/cannot be used with AI?
4. Are there specific use cases that require approval?
5. Who should I contact with questions?
