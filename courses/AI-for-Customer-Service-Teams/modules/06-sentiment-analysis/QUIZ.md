## Answer Key

### Section 1: Multiple Choice

1. **B** - Patterns in language that indicate emotional tone
   - *AI detects patterns, not true emotions. It's sophisticated pattern matching.*

2. **B** - "Oh great, another delay. What a surprise." (sarcasm)
   - *Sarcasm uses positive words ("great") with negative intent—confuses AI.*

3. **B** - To enable proactive intervention when customers become frustrated
   - *Real-time monitoring allows early intervention before situations escalate.*

4. **B** - Customer mentions "lawyer," "lawsuit," or legal action
   - *Legal language requires immediate human handling, not just alerts.*

5. **B** - Customer's emotional state is getting progressively worse
   - *Declining trend means each message is more negative than the previous.*

6. **B** - It predicts churn risk and enables proactive retention
   - *Long-term sentiment patterns predict customer behavior better than single interactions.*

7. **B** - Extracting themes and insights from customer feedback across many interactions
   - *VoC analysis aggregates feedback to identify patterns and themes.*

8. **B** - It may misinterpret sarcasm, cultural expressions, and context-dependent language
   - *These nuances are difficult for AI to reliably detect.*

9. **B** - What was detected, suggested approach, and response options
   - *Useful prompts provide context and actionable guidance, not just alerts.*

10. **B** - Share insights with product, marketing, and support for comprehensive action
    - *Sentiment insights benefit multiple teams for different purposes.*

### Section 2: True/False

11. **False** - AI detects patterns in language but doesn't truly understand or feel emotions.

12. **True** - Declining sentiment over time is a strong indicator of customer churn risk.

13. **False** - Prompts should inform and guide, not mandate interruption. Agents use judgment.

14. **False** - "Fine." is context-dependent and often indicates passive acceptance or mild dissatisfaction.

15. **True** - Support interactions contain valuable product feedback that helps prioritize improvements.

### Section 3: Scenario-Based

16. **B** - Declining sentiment trend requiring intervention
    - *Four consecutive messages with worsening sentiment is a clear declining pattern.*

17. **C** - Neutral to slightly negative - expressed concern but measured tone
    - *Customer explicitly denies anger while raising legitimate concern—measured negative.*

18. **C** - High risk - multiple strong churn indicators present
    - *Very negative sentiment + competitor mention + increased contacts + declining trend = high risk.*

19. **B** - Potential mobile app issue causing customer frustration - investigate urgently
    - *High volume + negative sentiment + significant increase = emerging issue requiring attention.*

20. **B** - Acknowledge the prompt, consider the guidance, but use judgment
    - *Prompts inform; agents decide. If the approach is working, continue thoughtfully.*
