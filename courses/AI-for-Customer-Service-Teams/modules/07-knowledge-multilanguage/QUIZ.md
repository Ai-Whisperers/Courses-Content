## Section 3: Scenario-Based Questions (5 questions, 1 point each)

### Question 16
**Scenario:** Your gap analysis shows these unmatched queries:
- "Mobile app crashes" - 120 mentions, very negative sentiment
- "Gift cards for corporate" - 15 mentions, neutral sentiment
- "Change password" - 80 mentions, neutral sentiment (article exists but hard to find)

**Question:** What is the CORRECT prioritization?

A) Gift cards first - it's a revenue opportunity
B) Password first - it has the most mentions
C) Mobile app crashes first - high volume AND negative sentiment indicates urgent problem
D) All equal priority

**Scenario:** Your translation QA finds that a translated article has:
- Accuracy score: 4/5
- Fluency score: 5/5
- Terminology score: 2/5 (key terms inconsistent with glossary)
- Brand voice score: 4/5

Your pass threshold requires all criteria >= 3.

**Question:** What should happen?

A) Publish - overall average is high
B) Reject and revise terminology before publishing
C) Publish but note the terminology issue

B) The Password Reset article should appear - semantic search understands the intent is about account access
C) An error message
D) Only exact matches should appear

### Question 20
**Scenario:** Your content freshness monitor flags an article because:
- Last updated: 8 months ago
- Product team released related feature update last week
- 3 agents marked information as incorrect this month

**Question:** What priority should this review have?

A) Low - 8 months isn't that old
B) Medium - schedule for next quarterly review
C) High/Urgent - multiple signals suggest content is outdated and may be causing issues
D) No priority - wait for customer complaints

## Answer Key

### Section 1: Multiple Choice

1. **B** - It understands meaning and finds relevant results even without exact keyword matches
   - *Semantic search uses AI to match intent, not just words.*

2. **B** - Identifying topics customers ask about that have no knowledge base coverage
   - *Gap analysis finds what's missing by analyzing customer queries.*

3. **B** - Structured with metadata, keywords, related questions, and clear sections
   - *Structured content enables AI to search, extract, and recommend effectively.*

4. **B** - AI draft followed by professional translator review
   - *Critical content requires human verification for accuracy and compliance.*

5. **B** - AI pulling the specific answer from a longer article to show users
   - *Answer extraction highlights the relevant information without showing entire articles.*

6. **B** - Agents frequently correct or override information from the article
   - *Agent corrections signal that content may be inaccurate or outdated.*

7. **B** - Ensuring consistent translation of key terms across all content
   - *Glossaries maintain terminology consistency in translations.*

### Section 2: True/False

11. **False** - AI translation requires review, especially for critical content. Errors can cause significant issues.

12. **True** - Semantic search understands meaning, so "can't login" finds "password reset" articles.

13. **False** - Cultural adaptation (formality, communication style, formatting) is essential beyond word translation.

14. **True** - Comprehensive gap analysis uses multiple data sources to identify missing content.

15. **True** - Localization includes formatting conventions that vary by region.

### Section 3: Scenario-Based

16. **C** - Mobile app crashes first - high volume AND negative sentiment indicates urgent problem
    - *Combination of frequency and negative impact makes this highest priority.*
