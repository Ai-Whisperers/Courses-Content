## Section 3: Scenario-Based Questions (5 questions, 1 point each)

### Question 16
**Scenario:** Your support team receives 500 tickets per day. 60% are simple FAQ-type questions, 30% require account lookup, and 10% are complex issues requiring judgment. You're evaluating an AI chatbot that claims 70% deflection rate.

**Question:** What is the MAXIMUM realistic deflection this chatbot could achieve?

A) 70% of all tickets
B) 60% of all tickets (the FAQ portion)
C) 90% of all tickets
D) 100% of all tickets

### Question 17
**Scenario:** You're conducting an AI experiment with response suggestions. The AI generates a response to an angry customer that says: "I completely understand your frustration and I feel terrible about this situation."

**Question:** What is the BEST edit to make this response more authentic?

A) Keep it as is—empathy is important
B) Remove the emotional claims ("feel terrible") and focus on acknowledging the issue and providing solutions
C) Make the empathy statement stronger
D) Remove all empathy and just state the facts

### Question 18
**Scenario:** Your AI vendor evaluation shows:
- Vendor A: Higher accuracy, no integration with your helpdesk, $$$
- Vendor B: Lower accuracy, native integration with your helpdesk, $$

**Question:** Which factor should weigh MOST heavily in your decision?

A) Accuracy is king—always choose the most accurate option
B) Integration capabilities—a tool you can't use provides no value
C) Cost is the only factor that matters
D) Choose based on the vendor's size and reputation alone

### Question 19
**Scenario:** You're presenting your AI business case to leadership. They ask: "What if the AI makes a mistake that upsets a customer?"

**Question:** What is the BEST response?

A) "The AI won't make mistakes—it's very accurate."
B) "We'll have human oversight, escalation paths, and continuous monitoring to catch and correct errors quickly."
C) "We'll just apologize to customers when it happens."
D) "That's why we shouldn't implement AI."

### Question 20
**Scenario:** After running a 2-week AI response suggestion pilot, you find:
- Time savings: 35%
- Quality scores: Unchanged
- Agent satisfaction: 80% want to continue
- One agent refuses to use it

**Question:** What should you conclude?

A) Cancel the AI initiative because not everyone supports it
B) The pilot is successful—proceed with broader rollout while addressing the resistant agent's concerns
C) Force all agents to use AI immediately
D) The results are inconclusive—run another pilot

## Answer Key

### Section 1: Multiple Choice

1. **B** - AI learns from data and improves over time, while traditional automation follows fixed rules
   - *AI's learning capability distinguishes it from rule-based automation.*

2. **B** - Natural Language Processing (NLP)
   - *NLP specifically handles understanding human language and intent.*

3. **C** - Assist agents with routine tasks so they can focus on complex issues
   - *The augmentation model uses AI to enhance human capabilities, not replace them.*

4. **B** - Integration
   - *IMPACT: Integration, Measurable results, Privacy, Accuracy, Cost, Training.*

5. **B** - Average handle time (AHT) reduction
   - *AHT directly translates to labor cost savings and is measurable.*

6. **C** - Cannot provide genuine empathy or make complex judgment calls
   - *AI recognizes patterns but doesn't truly understand emotions or make nuanced judgments.*

7. **C** - Auto-categorization and ticket routing
   - *High accuracy achievable, immediate impact, minimal risk.*

8. **B** - Current baseline metrics and performance data
   - *You need a baseline to measure improvement and calculate ROI.*

9. **C** - They claim 99%+ accuracy on complex tasks without evidence
   - *Unrealistic claims without proof suggest either dishonesty or misunderstanding.*

10. **B** - Letting customers know when they're interacting with AI

### Section 2: True/False

11. **False** - AI augments but cannot completely replace human agents for complex, empathetic, and judgment-requiring interactions.

12. **True** - Pilots demonstrate value, reduce risk, and build support before major investments.

13. **True** - The 80/20 rule in support suggests most queries are routine and repetitive.

14. **False** - Customer-centric AI must always provide a path to human help.

15. **False** - AI can detect sentiment patterns but doesn't actually feel or understand emotions.

### Section 3: Scenario-Based

    - *Only the 60% FAQ-type questions are suitable for chatbot deflection; the rest require account access or human judgment.*

17. **B** - Remove the emotional claims and focus on acknowledging the issue and providing solutions
    - *AI claiming to "feel terrible" is inauthentic; better to acknowledge and solve.*

18. **B** - Integration capabilities
    - *A tool that doesn't integrate provides zero value regardless of accuracy.*

19. **B** - We'll have human oversight, escalation paths, and continuous monitoring
    - *Acknowledge risk exists while explaining mitigation strategies.*

20. **B** - The pilot is successful—proceed with broader rollout while addressing concerns
