## Part 3: First AI Experiment (30 points)

### Task
Conduct an AI-assisted response generation experiment using ChatGPT or Claude.

### Instructions

**Step 1: Setup (5 points)**

Create a prompt template for generating customer service responses. Your template should include:
- Company context
- Brand voice guidelines

Additional context:
- Product: [if applicable]
- Customer tier: [if known]

Generate a response that:
1. [Requirement 1]
2. [Requirement 2]
3. [Requirement 3]

Keep the response under [X] words.
```

Document your final prompt template.

**Step 2: Test with Sample Tickets (15 points)**

Use your prompt template to generate responses for these 5 sample tickets:

**Ticket 1: Billing Question**
> "I was charged twice for my subscription this month. Can you help me get a refund? I've been a customer for 3 years and this has never happened before."

**Ticket 2: Technical Issue**
> "The app keeps crashing every time I try to upload a photo. I've tried restarting my phone but it still doesn't work. This is really frustrating."

**Ticket 3: Feature Request**
> "It would be really helpful if you added dark mode to the app. My eyes get tired looking at the bright screen at night. Is this something you're considering?"

**Ticket 4: Angry Customer**
> "THIS IS RIDICULOUS! I've been waiting 5 days for my order and tracking shows it hasn't even shipped! I paid for express shipping! I want a full refund NOW!!!"

**Ticket 5: Complex Issue**
