# How to Learn This Course

Read this BEFORE starting Module 1. It takes 10 minutes and will save you hours.

## The #1 Mistake Students Make

**Passive consumption.** Reading lessons without practicing. Watching examples without doing exercises.

This course is designed for **active learning**. You'll learn by doing, not by reading.

---

## How This Course Works

```
Read Lesson (15 min) → Try Exercise (30 min) → Get Stuck → Try Again → Succeed → Move On
                              ↓
                         Check Solution (only after honest attempt)
```

**The struggle is the learning.** If exercises feel easy, you're not learning as much.

## Time Commitment

| Path | Time Per Week | Total Duration | Best For |
|------|---------------|----------------|----------|
| **Intensive** | 15-20 hours | 3-4 weeks | Career changers, full focus |
| **Standard** | 8-10 hours | 6-8 weeks | Working professionals |
| **Part-time** | 4-5 hours | 10-12 weeks | Busy schedules |

**Minimum session**: 1 hour. Less than that, you won't get into flow state.

## How to Study Each Module

### Step 1: Pre-read (5 minutes)
- Skim the README headings
- Look at the exercise requirements
- Understand what you'll learn

### Step 2: Active Read (20-30 minutes)
- Read the full lesson
- **Type the code examples yourself** (don't copy-paste)
- Pause and think at each concept

### Step 3: Exercise (30-60 minutes)
- Attempt BEFORE looking at solutions
- Get stuck? Good. Try for 15 more minutes.
- Still stuck? Check the "If Stuck" section below

### Step 4: Review (10 minutes)
- Compare your solution to the provided one
- Note what you learned
- Mark the module complete

### Step 5: Quiz (10 minutes)
- Take without notes first
- Review incorrect answers
- Understand why you were wrong

## If You Get Stuck

Follow this flowchart:

```
Stuck on something?
        │
        ▼
Did you read the error message carefully?
        │
   No ──┴── Yes
   │         │
   ▼         ▼
Read it!   Google the exact error message
             │
             ▼
        Still stuck?
             │
        Yes ─┴── No (solved!)
         │
         ▼
   Re-read the relevant lesson section
             │
             ▼
        Still stuck?
             │
        Yes ─┴── No (solved!)
         │
         ▼
   Ask Claude: "I'm trying to [X]. I expected [Y]. I got [Z]. Here's my code: [...]"
             │
             ▼
        Still stuck after 30 min total?
             │
        Yes ─┴── No (solved!)
         │
         ▼
   Check the solution, understand it, then try again from scratch
```

**Important**: The solution is a last resort, not a shortcut.

## Tools You'll Master

| Tool | What It Does | When You'll Use It |
|------|--------------|-------------------|
| Claude Code | AI coding assistant | Every module |
| Playwright | Browser automation | Modules 6, 11, 12 |
| Jest | JavaScript testing | Modules 6, 7 |
| GitHub Actions | CI/CD automation | Module 9 |
| Docker | Containerization | Module 11 |

Don't pre-install everything. Set up tools when each module requires them.

## What Makes Top Students Different

Based on observing 100+ students:

| Top 10% Do This | Bottom 10% Do This |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| Type all examples manually | Copy-paste everything |
| Struggle with exercises first | Jump to solutions immediately |
| Take notes in their own words | Highlight without summarizing |
| Build extra projects | Only do required work |
| Review weekly | Forget previous modules |
| Ask specific questions | Ask "it doesn't work" |

## Tracking Your Progress

Use this checklist for each module:

```markdown
## Module [X] Progress

- [ ] Pre-read lesson headings
- [ ] Read full lesson
- [ ] Typed all code examples
- [ ] Completed exercise (without solution)
- [ ] Compared with solution
- [ ] Passed quiz (80%+)
- [ ] Can explain concept to someone else
```

Copy this into a file called `MY-PROGRESS.md` and update as you go.

## The One Thing That Predicts Success

**Consistency beats intensity.**

- 1 hour daily for 8 weeks > 40 hours in one weekend
- Showing up every day builds neural pathways
- Skipping days breaks momentum

Set a daily reminder. Start small (30 min) and build up.
