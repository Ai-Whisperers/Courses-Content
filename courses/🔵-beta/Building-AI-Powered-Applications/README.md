## Course Description

Transform from a developer who uses AI tools into one who builds production-ready AI-powered applications. This comprehensive course teaches you to integrate LLM APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic), work with embeddings and vector databases, implement RAG systems, build intelligent chatbots, and deploy AI applications to production with proper monitoring and cost optimization.

The focus is on production-grade patterns that scale. By course completion, you'll have built and deployed a complete AI application and possess the skills to add AI features to any project.
