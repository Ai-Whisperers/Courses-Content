## Course Description

This course transforms developers into AI application builders who can deliver production-ready AI-powered systems. Students learn to integrate LLM APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic), work with embeddings and vector databases, implement RAG systems, build intelligent chatbots, and deploy AI applications to production with proper monitoring and cost optimization. The focus is on production-grade patterns that scale. By course completion, developers will have built and deployed a complete AI application and possess the skills to add AI features to any project.
