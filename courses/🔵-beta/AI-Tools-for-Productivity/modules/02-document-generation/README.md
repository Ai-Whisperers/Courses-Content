## 1. AI-Assisted Document Creation Framework

### The Document Creation Workflow

AI transforms document creation from a blank-page problem to an editing and refinement process. Here's the recommended workflow:

```
1. DEFINE → What document? Who's the audience? What's the purpose?
2. PROMPT → Request initial draft with specific context
3. GENERATE → AI produces first version
4. REVIEW → Assess structure, content, accuracy
5. REFINE → Request specific improvements
6. EDIT → Manual adjustments for voice and precision
7. VERIFY → Fact-check and context-check
8. FINALIZE → Polish and format for delivery
```

### Setting Up Your Document Prompts

Every document prompt should include:

| Element | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Document type | "Write a project status report" |
| Audience | "for senior leadership" |
| Length/format | "2 pages, with executive summary" |
| Key content | "covering Q3 milestones, risks, next steps" |
| Tone | "professional but accessible" |
| Constraints | "avoid technical jargon" |

**Template Prompt Structure:**
```
I need to create a [DOCUMENT TYPE] for [AUDIENCE].

Context:
- [Relevant background information]
- [Key points to include]
- [Constraints or requirements]

The document should be [LENGTH] and have a [TONE] tone.

Please include:
- [Specific section 1]
- [Specific section 2]
- [Specific section 3]
```

## 2. Requirements Documents

### Product Requirements Document (PRD)

PRDs communicate what needs to be built. AI accelerates PRD creation by structuring your ideas.

**Effective PRD Prompt:**
```
Create a PRD for [FEATURE/PRODUCT].

Context:
- Product: [product name and current state]
- Problem: [problem being solved]
- Users: [target users]

Include these sections:
1. Problem Statement
2. Goals and Success Metrics
3. User Stories (3-5 key stories)
4. Requirements (functional and non-functional)
5. Out of Scope
6. Timeline Considerations
7. Open Questions

Keep each section concise but complete.
```

**Example Output Review Checklist:**
- [ ] Problem clearly articulated
- [ ] Goals are measurable
- [ ] User stories follow proper format
- [ ] Requirements are specific and testable
- [ ] Scope boundaries are clear
- [ ] No contradictions between sections

### Business Requirements Document (BRD)

BRDs focus on business needs rather than technical solutions.

**BRD Prompt Template:**
```
Create a Business Requirements Document for [PROJECT].

Business Context:
- Current situation: [describe]
- Business problem: [describe]
- Stakeholders: [list key stakeholders]

Include:
1. Executive Summary

3. Scope and Boundaries
4. Stakeholder Analysis
5. Business Requirements (prioritized)
6. Constraints and Assumptions
7. Success Criteria
8. Risks and Dependencies
```

### User Stories

AI excels at generating user stories from high-level descriptions.

**User Story Generation Prompt:**
```
Generate user stories for [FEATURE].

Feature description: [describe the feature]
User types: [list user roles]

Format each story as:
"As a [user type], I want to [action] so that [benefit]"

Include acceptance criteria for each story.
Generate 5-7 stories covering the main use cases.
```

**Quality Check for User Stories:**
- Follows "As a... I want... so that..." format
- Each story is independent and valuable
- Acceptance criteria are testable
- Covers both happy path and edge cases

## 6. Maintaining Your Voice

### The Voice Preservation Problem

AI can make your writing sound generic. Strategies to maintain authenticity:

**Personal Voice Prompt:**
```
Here are examples of my writing style:

Example 1:
[Paste a paragraph you've written]

Example 2:
[Paste another paragraph]

Now, write [new content request] in this same style.
```

**Style Guidelines Prompt:**
```
When writing for me, follow these style guidelines:
- Sentence length: [short and punchy / longer and detailed]
- Vocabulary: [simple / technical / industry-specific terms I use]
- Structure: [bullets / paragraphs / mixed]
- Tone: [describe your natural tone]
- Avoid: [words or phrases you don't use]
```

### The 80/20 Rule

Let AI do 80% of the structural and drafting work. You provide the 20% that makes it uniquely yours:

- Your specific examples and anecdotes
- Judgment calls and recommendations
- Nuanced context only you know
- Final tone and word choice adjustments
- Voice and personality touches

### Quality Control Checklist

Before using any AI-generated document:

- [ ] Read it completely - don't skim
- [ ] Verify all facts and figures
- [ ] Check that names and titles are correct
- [ ] Ensure context is appropriate for your organization
- [ ] Adjust any language that doesn't sound like you
- [ ] Remove any AI artifacts or generic phrases
- [ ] Confirm the action items or asks are clear
- [ ] Review for confidential information handling

## Best Practices Summary

1. **Start with structure** - Define document type, audience, and purpose first
2. **Provide context** - The more context, the better the output
3. **Iterate deliberately** - Request specific improvements, not vague changes
4. **Fact-check everything** - AI can hallucinate statistics and references
5. **Preserve your voice** - Edit to sound like you, not like AI
6. **Build templates** - Save effective prompts for reuse
7. **Review critically** - Every document needs human judgment

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

| Pitfall | Problem | Solution |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Generic outputs | Sound like everyone else | Provide style examples, edit for voice |
| Hallucinated facts | AI invents statistics | Verify every number and claim |
| Wrong tone | Too formal/casual for context | Specify audience and relationship |
| Bloated content | AI tends to over-explain | Request conciseness, specify length |
| Missing context | AI doesn't know your situation | Include relevant background |
| Inconsistent voice | Mixing AI and human text | Edit entire document for consistency |

---
