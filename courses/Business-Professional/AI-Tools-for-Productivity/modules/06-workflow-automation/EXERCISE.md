## Reflection Questions

1. What was the most challenging part of designing your workflow?

2. How accurate was your initial time savings estimate after testing?

3. What would you do differently when building your next workflow?

4. How will you ensure you actually use this workflow consistently?

5. What other tasks are you now thinking about automating?

---

## Tips for Success

- Be realistic about time savings - small wins compound
- Test templates with real scenarios
- Keep documentation simple enough to actually use
- Plan for iteration - first version is a starting point
- Think about edge cases and variations
