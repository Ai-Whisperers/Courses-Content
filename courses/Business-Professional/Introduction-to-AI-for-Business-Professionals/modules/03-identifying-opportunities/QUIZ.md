## Answer Key

### Section 1: Multiple Choice

1. **B** - Process inefficiency, Analysis needs, Information overload, Natural language tasks
   - *Explanation: PAIN is a systematic framework for finding AI opportunities.*

2. **B** - Whether the task happens frequently enough to justify automation
   - *Explanation: High volume ensures AI investment is worthwhile.*

3. **C** - High volume of similar tasks with clear inputs/outputs
   - *Explanation: These characteristics enable effective AI learning and automation.*

4. **B** - Data centralized but messy, needs cleaning
   - *Explanation: Level 3 means data exists in one place but requires preparation.*

5. **B** - Enablement (data and infrastructure readiness)
   - *Explanation: E measures whether the organization can execute the opportunity.*

6. **C** - High feasibility, moderate-to-high value
   - *Explanation: Quick wins are achievable and deliver meaningful value.*

7. **B** - "We can't predict why customers leave"
   - *Explanation: Prediction needs signal opportunities for predictive AI.*

8. **C** - 60%
   - *Explanation: Quick wins build momentum (60% quick wins, 30% optimization, 10% transformation).*

9. **B** - "What takes the most time and is repetitive?"
   - *Explanation: This identifies process inefficiencies suitable for AI.*

10. **B** - Assuming data exists and is ready without checking
    - *Explanation: Many AI projects fail because data assumptions were wrong.*

### Section 2: True/False

11. **False** - Feasibility and readiness are equally important; high value with low feasibility may fail.

12. **True** - 4/4 means high volume, homogeneous, historical data, and human bottleneck - excellent candidate.

13. **False** - Start with business problems, then identify if AI is the right solution.

14. **True** - Quality data produces better AI results than large amounts of poor data.

15. **False** - Quick wins should come first to build organizational capability and confidence.

### Section 3: Scenario-Based

16. **D** - 4/4 - Excellent candidate

17. **B** - Level 2 - Data exists but scattered
    - *Explanation: Data exists but is in silos; integration needed before AI.*

18. **B** - High value but challenging feasibility - fix data/tech blockers first
    - *Explanation: High value (V=5) but low achievability (A=2) and enablement (E=2) indicates blockers.*

19. **B** - Redirect to start with specific business problems, not technology
    - *Explanation: Solution-first thinking is a common pitfall; start with problems.*
