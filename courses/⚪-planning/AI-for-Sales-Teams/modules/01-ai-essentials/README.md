## Section 4: Ethical AI in Sales

### Core Principles

```
ETHICAL AI USE IN SALES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

TRANSPARENCY
├── Don't pretend AI content is fully original
├── Disclose AI use when asked directly
└── Never use AI to deceive or manipulate

ACCURACY
├── Always verify AI-generated information
├── Don't share unverified "facts"
└── Correct errors promptly

PRIVACY
├── Don't input confidential prospect data
├── Respect data protection regulations
└── Follow company data policies

AUTHENTICITY
├── AI assists your voice, not replaces it
├── Maintain genuine human connection
└── Personalization must be sincere

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### What Not to Do

| Unethical Practice | Why It's Wrong | Alternative |
|-------------------|----------------|-------------|
| Fake personalization | Damages trust when discovered | Genuine AI-assisted personalization |
| Fabricated case studies | Fraud; legal liability | Use real examples or clear hypotheticals |
| Misrepresenting AI research | Creates false expectations | Verify all claims |
| Impersonating relationships | Deceptive; harms brand | Be authentic about connection level |
