## Part 1: Personalized Cold Emails (35 points)

### Task
Write personalized cold emails for 5 contacts from your Module 2 research.

### Instructions

**Step 1: Select Your Contacts**

Choose 5 contacts from your Module 2 research portfolio:

```yaml
outreach_contacts:
  contact_1:
    name: "[Name]"
    title: "[Title]"
    company: "[Company]"
    research_summary: "[Key points from Module 2 research]"
    trigger_event: "[If applicable]"
    personalization_angle: "[Chosen hook]"

  # Repeat for contacts 2-5
```

**Step 2: Generate AI-Assisted Drafts**

For each contact, use this prompt and document results:

```yaml
email_creation_process:
  contact: "[Name]"

  prompt_used: |
    [Paste the prompt you used - should include context,
    research, requirements per the module content]

  ai_generated_draft: |
    Subject: [Subject line]

    [Full email body as generated by AI]

  authenticity_edits:
    - original: "[Original phrase]"
      edited: "[Your edited version]"
      reason: "[Why you changed it]"

    - original: "[Another phrase]"
      edited: "[Your version]"
      reason: "[Why]"

    subject: "[Final subject line]"
    body: |
      [Final email after your edits - 75-125 words]

  personalization_analysis:
    level: "[1-4 based on module spectrum]"
    specific_elements:
      - "[Element 1 that makes this personal]"
      - "[Element 2]"
    why_effective: |
      [Why this personalization should resonate - 30-50 words]
```

**Step 3: Create Subject Line Variations**

For each email, provide 3 subject line options with A/B testing rationale:

```yaml
subject_line_testing:
  contact: "[Name]"

  option_a:
    subject: "[Subject line A]"
    character_count: [number]
    strategy: "[Personalized/Curiosity/Question/Trigger/Value]"

  option_b:
    subject: "[Subject line B]"
    character_count: [number]
    strategy: "[Different strategy]"

  option_c:
    subject: "[Subject line C]"
    character_count: [number]
    strategy: "[Another strategy]"

  primary_choice: "[A/B/C]"
  testing_plan: "[Which to A/B test and why]"
```

### Deliverable

## Tips for Success

1. **Research First**: Quality personalization requires quality research from Module 2
2. **Edit Ruthlessly**: AI drafts are starting points, not final products
3. **Verify Everything**: Double-check any facts before including them
4. **Sound Like You**: If it doesn't sound like something you'd say, change it
5. **Value Over Pitch**: Lead with helpfulness, not your agenda
6. **Test and Learn**: A/B testing improves future campaigns
