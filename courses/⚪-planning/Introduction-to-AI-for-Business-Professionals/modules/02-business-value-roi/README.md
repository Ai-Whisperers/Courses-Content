## 1. Where AI Creates Business Value

### The Value Equation

AI creates value in four primary ways:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    AI VALUE CREATION                        │
├──────────────────┬──────────────────┬──────────────────────┤
│   EFFICIENCY     │    REVENUE       │    RISK              │
│   Save time/cost │    Grow sales    │    Reduce exposure   │
├──────────────────┼──────────────────┼──────────────────────┤
│   EXPERIENCE     │                  │                      │
│   Improve CX/EX  │                  │                      │
└──────────────────┴──────────────────┴──────────────────────┘
```

## 3. Calculating ROI for AI

### The Basic ROI Formula

```
ROI = (Value Created - Total Cost) / Total Cost × 100%

Value Created = Efficiency Gains + Revenue Gains + Risk Reduction + Experience Value
Total Cost = Implementation + Ongoing Operations + Opportunity Cost
```

### Simple ROI Calculator

**Step 1: Quantify Value**

| Value Type | Calculation | Annual Value |
|------------|-------------|--------------|
| Time saved | Hours × Rate × Tasks | $ |
| Revenue increase | % Lift × Revenue | $ |
| Cost avoided | Previous losses × % reduction | $ |
| **Total Annual Value** | | **$** |

**Step 2: Calculate Costs**

| Cost Type | One-Time | Annual |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| Software/licensing | $ | $ |
| Implementation | $ | |
| Integration | $ | |
| Training | $ | $ |
| Maintenance | | $ |
| Support | | $ |
| **Total** | **$** | **$** |

**Step 3: Calculate ROI**

```
Year 1 ROI = (Annual Value - Year 1 Costs) / Year 1 Costs × 100%
Year 3 ROI = (3 × Annual Value - Total 3-Year Costs) / Total 3-Year Costs × 100%
```

### ROI Example: Customer Service Chatbot

**Scenario:**
- Current: 10 agents handling 1,000 tickets/day
- Goal: AI handles 30% of simple tickets

**Value Calculation:**
| Value Type | Calculation | Annual Value |
|------------|-------------|--------------|
| Agent time saved | 300 tickets × 10 min × $0.50/min × 365 days | $547,500 |
| After-hours coverage | New tickets resolved × value | $100,000 |
| Faster resolution | Customer satisfaction improvement | $50,000 |
| **Total Annual Value** | | **$697,500** |

**Cost Calculation:**
| Cost Type | One-Time | Annual |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| Chatbot platform | | $60,000 |
| Implementation | $40,000 | |
| Integration | $30,000 | |
| Training content | $20,000 | $10,000 |
| Maintenance | | $15,000 |
| **Total** | **$90,000** | **$85,000** |

**ROI:**
- Year 1: ($697,500 - $175,000) / $175,000 = 298% ROI
- Year 3: ($2,092,500 - $345,000) / $345,000 = 506% ROI

### When ROI is Harder to Calculate

Some AI benefits are difficult to quantify:

**Strategic Value:**
- First-mover advantage
- Competitive positioning
- Brand perception

**Enablement Value:**
- New capabilities that weren't possible before
- Platform for future innovations

**Compound Value:**
- AI that makes other AI more effective
- Data flywheel effects

**Approach for hard-to-quantify benefits:**
1. Acknowledge they exist but don't force numbers
2. Use qualitative scoring alongside quantitative ROI
3. Benchmark against competitors who don't have the capability
4. Track proxy metrics (market share, customer acquisition)
