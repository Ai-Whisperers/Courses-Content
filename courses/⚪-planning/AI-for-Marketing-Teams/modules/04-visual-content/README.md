## 1. AI Image Generation Fundamentals

### How AI Image Generation Works

AI image generators (Midjourney, DALL-E, Stable Diffusion, Canva AI) create images from text descriptions called "prompts." Understanding prompt structure dramatically improves results.

### The Prompt Framework for Marketing Images

```
[Subject] + [Style] + [Mood/Lighting] + [Composition] + [Technical Details]
```

**Example:**
```
Subject: Professional woman working on laptop in modern office
Style: Clean corporate photography style
Mood: Bright, optimistic, natural lighting
Composition: Medium shot, shallow depth of field
Technical: High resolution, 16:9 aspect ratio
```

### Platform Comparison

| Platform | Best For | Pricing | Learning Curve |
|----------|----------|---------|----------------|
| **Canva AI** | Quick social graphics, brand consistency | Free tier | Low |
| **DALL-E** | Realistic images, product mockups | Pay-per-use | Low |
| **Midjourney** | Artistic, high-quality visuals | Subscription | Medium |
| **Adobe Firefly** | Professional design integration | Adobe CC | Medium |
| **Stable Diffusion** | Customization, local control | Free (self-host) | High |

## 6. Legal Considerations

### AI Image Rights and Usage

| Consideration | Guidance |

| **Commercial Use** | Check each platform's terms; most allow commercial use |
| **Copyright** | AI outputs generally aren't copyrightable (US) |
| **Training Data** | Potential legal risk from copyrighted training data |
| **Model Releases** | AI faces don't need releases, but disclosure may be required |
| **Trademark** | Avoid generating trademarked elements |
| **Disclosure** | Some platforms require AI image disclosure |

### Best Practices

```
DO:
✓ Read and follow platform terms of service
✓ Disclose AI use where required/expected
✓ Keep records of prompts and outputs
✓ Avoid generating real people's faces
✓ Be cautious with brand elements
✓ Use for internal/marketing purposes with care

DON'T:
✗ Generate images of real people without consent
✗ Create deceptive content (fake testimonials, etc.)
✗ Assume all AI images are legally safe
✗ Use for sensitive/controversial content
✗ Infringe on trademarks or copyrights
✗ Sell AI images as "original art" without disclosure
```

### Platform-Specific Disclosure

- **Meta (Facebook/Instagram)**: Required for realistic AI images in ads

- **Google Ads**: Must comply with synthetic content policies
- **Stock sites**: Generally cannot upload AI images as your own
