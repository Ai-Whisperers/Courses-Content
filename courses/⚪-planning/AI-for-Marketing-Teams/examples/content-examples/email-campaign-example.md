## Email 1: Value Delivery

### AI Generated:

**Subject Lines:**
1. Your AI Marketing Playbook is here
2. Here's your playbook + a quick tip
3. The playbook + what most people miss

**Preview:** Download inside, plus one thing 80% of marketers skip

**Body:**
```
Hi [First Name],

Your AI Marketing Playbook is attached. Thanks for downloading it.

Before you dive in, here's something that will make it 10x more useful:

Most marketers read the playbook, try a few prompts, and get frustrated
when the output sounds generic. They assume AI just isn't good enough
for their brand.

The real problem? They skip page 7.

That's where we cover the Brand Context Document—a simple one-page
template that transforms AI output from generic to branded.

Here's why it matters:

AI doesn't remember your brand between sessions. Without context,
it defaults to average internet writing. Your brand context doc is
the difference between content that sounds like everyone and content
that sounds like you.

Start there. Everything else builds on it.

Questions about implementation? Just reply to this email.

Best,

P.S. Page 12 has our actual prompt templates. Those alone have saved
our clients 10+ hours per week.
```

### Final Version (Edited):

**Subject Line:** Your playbook + the one thing 80% skip

**Preview:** Most people miss page 7. Don't be most people.

Hi [First Name],

Your AI Marketing Playbook: [LINK]

Before you dive in, a quick heads up that'll save you frustration.

Most marketers read this playbook, try a few prompts, get generic
output, and conclude: "AI doesn't work for my brand."

Wrong conclusion.

The problem is they skip page 7.

That's the Brand Context Document—a one-page template that transforms
AI from generic to branded.

Why it matters: AI has no memory. Every session starts blank. Without
your brand context doc, it defaults to "average internet writing."

With it? Content that actually sounds like you.

Start with page 7. Everything else builds on that foundation.

Hit reply if you have questions. I read every email.

P.S. Page 12 has our exact prompt templates. Those alone save our
clients 10+ hours/week on content.
```

**Changes:**
- Shortened subject line
- More direct preview text
- Cleaner formatting with line breaks
- Removed "Thanks for downloading" (assumed)
- Made P.S. more specific

## Email 2: Problem Deepening

### AI Generated:

**Subject Lines:**
1. The hidden cost of generic content
2. Why your AI content isn't working
3. The real reason AI output falls flat

**Preview:** It's not the AI. It's this.

**Body:**
```
Hi [First Name],

Quick question: Have you ever published content that felt... off?

Not wrong, exactly. Just somehow not quite right. Like it could have
been written by anyone.

That's the AI content trap. And it's costing you more than you think.

Generic content doesn't just fail to engage. It actively damages trust.
Your audience can tell when something lacks personality. They might not
say "this was written by AI," but they'll think "this brand doesn't
really get me."

The result? Lower engagement, fewer conversions, and a slow erosion
of the brand you've worked hard to build.

Here's the thing: This problem is completely fixable.

We've helped 50+ B2B companies implement AI content systems that
maintain brand voice. The difference isn't better AI—it's better process.

Would it help to see how other companies in your space are doing it?

Reply "yes" and I'll send over a quick case study.

Best,
[Name]
```

### Final Version (Edited):

**Subject Line:** Why your AI content feels "off"

**Preview:** It's not the AI. It's the process.

**Body:**
```
Hi [First Name],

Ever publish something that felt... off?

Not wrong. Just not quite right. Like it could've been written by
anyone. About anything. For nobody in particular.

That's the AI content trap.

And it's costing more than you think.

Generic content doesn't just fail to engage. It signals: "This brand
doesn't really get me." Your audience won't say "this was AI." They'll
just... leave.

Lower engagement. Fewer conversions. Brand erosion you won't notice
until it's a problem.

Here's what I want you to know: This is fixable.

We've helped 50+ B2B startups implement AI content that sounds human.
The difference isn't the AI tool. It's three process changes that take
30 minutes to set up.

Want to see how a company in [INDUSTRY] did it?

Reply "case study" and I'll send it over.

— [Name]

P.S. Spoiler: They went from 4 hours per blog post to 45 minutes.
Same quality. No generic fluff.
```

**Changes:**
- Stronger emotional hook
- More specific consequences
- Cleaner CTA (just say "case study")
- Added P.S. with specific result
- More conversational line breaks

## Email 3: Direct Offer

### AI Generated:

**Subject Lines:**
1. Let's solve your content problem
2. 15 minutes to fix your AI content
3. Quick call this week?

**Preview:** No pitch. Just answers to your questions.

**Body:**
```
Hi [First Name],

I'll keep this short.

If you've been struggling with AI-generated content that sounds generic,
you're not alone. It's the #1 challenge we hear from marketing leaders.

The good news? It's usually a process problem, not a tool problem.
And process problems are fixable.

Here's my offer:

Book a 15-minute strategy call with our team. No pitch, no pressure.
We'll look at your current content workflow and identify the specific
changes that would make AI work for your brand.

At minimum, you'll walk away with 2-3 actionable ideas you can implement
this week. At best, you'll have a clear roadmap for 2-3x content output
without sacrificing quality.

Interested? [CALENDAR LINK]

We have a few slots open this week and next.

Best,
[Name]

P.S. Still on the fence? Here's what [Client Name], VP of Marketing
at [Company], said after our call: "In 15 minutes, they identified
three gaps we'd been missing for months."
```

### Final Version (Edited):

**Subject Line:** 15 min to fix your AI content?

**Preview:** No pitch. Just a diagnostic.

**Body:**
```
Hi [First Name],

Quick one.

If AI content still feels like a struggle, you're not alone. It's the
#1 thing marketing leaders tell us.

But here's what I've learned: It's almost never the AI. It's the
process around it.

Process problems are fixable. Usually in one conversation.

So here's my offer:

→ 15-minute call
→ We diagnose your content workflow
→ You leave with 2-3 changes to implement this week

No pitch. No "let me tell you about our services."

Just answers.

If it's useful, great. If you want to work together later, we can
talk about that. If not, you still have actionable fixes.

Sound fair?
