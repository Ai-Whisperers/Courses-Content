## Section: AI Basics (8 questions)

### Q1.1
**Which of the following best describes how large language models generate content?**

A) They understand the meaning of text and create original ideas
B) They predict the most likely next words based on patterns in training data
C) They copy and paste relevant content from their training data
D) They use rules programmed by engineers to construct sentences

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** LLMs are pattern prediction systems. They don't truly "understand" meaning but predict statistically likely text based on their training. This is why they can produce plausible-sounding but factually incorrect content.

---

### Q1.2
**What is "AI hallucination" in the context of content generation?**

A) When AI produces content with spelling errors
B) When AI generates false or fabricated information that appears plausible
C) When AI refuses to complete a task
D) When AI produces content that is too short

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** AI hallucinations occur when models confidently generate information that is factually incorrect or entirely made up. This is why fact-checking AI outputs is essential.

---

### Q1.3
**Which task is AI MOST reliable for in marketing?**

A) Verifying statistics and claims
B) Generating first drafts and variations
C) Making strategic business decisions
D) Creating genuinely original campaign concepts

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** AI excels at generating initial drafts and creating variations quickly. It struggles with fact verification, strategic decisions, and true creative originality.

---

### Q1.4
**What is the "knowledge cutoff" of an AI model?**

A) The maximum length of content it can generate
B) The date after which the model has no training data
C) The number of topics it can discuss
D) The time limit for generating a response

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Knowledge cutoff refers to when the AI's training data ends. Events, products, or changes after this date are unknown to the model unless specifically updated.

---

### Q1.5
**Which statement about AI-generated URLs is TRUE?**

A) They are always accurate and functional
B) They should never be trusted without verification
C) They are more reliable than human-provided URLs
D) They only link to reputable sources

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** AI frequently generates plausible-looking but fake URLs. Never use an AI-generated URL without verifying it actually exists and leads to appropriate content.

---

### Q1.6
**What is the primary advantage of using AI for content creation?**

A) It eliminates the need for human editing
B) It guarantees factual accuracy
C) It increases speed and enables scale
D) It creates better content than humans

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** AI's main value is in speed and scale - producing drafts, variations, and iterations faster than humans alone. Quality still requires human review and editing.

---

### Q1.7
**When is AI LEAST suitable for marketing content?**

A) Creating email subject line variations
B) Drafting blog post outlines
C) Writing crisis communications
D) Generating social media post ideas

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Crisis communications require nuanced judgment, emotional intelligence, and strategic thinking that AI lacks. High-stakes, sensitive communications should be human-led.

---

### Q1.8
**What happens when you use the same prompt multiple times with AI?**

A) You get exactly the same output every time
B) You may get different outputs due to the probabilistic nature of AI
C) The AI refuses to respond to repeated prompts
D) The quality decreases with each repetition

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** AI generation involves randomness (temperature settings), so the same prompt can produce different outputs. This can be useful for generating variations.

---

## Section: REVIEW Framework (10 questions)

### Q1.9
**What does the "R" in the REVIEW framework stand for?**

A) Revise the content
B) Read the full output
C) Reduce word count
D) Research the topic

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** "R" stands for "Read" - reading the entire AI output carefully, not just skimming, to catch errors that may be buried in the middle of the text.

---

### Q1.10
**Why is it important to read the FULL AI output rather than skimming?**

A) AI always puts the best content at the end
B) Errors are often buried in the middle of the content
C) The formatting is only visible when reading closely
D) AI charges by the word, so you should verify quantity

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** AI can produce seemingly good content that contains errors in the middle sections. Skimming often catches opening and closing issues but misses problems throughout.

---

### Q1.11
**In the REVIEW framework, what does "Evaluate accuracy" mean?**

A) Check that the word count is correct
B) Verify facts, statistics, and claims are true
C) Ensure proper grammar and spelling
D) Confirm the format matches requirements

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** "Evaluate accuracy" means fact-checking all claims, statistics, dates, names, and other verifiable information in the AI output.

---

### Q1.12
**What should you do when AI generates a statistic you can't verify?**

A) Use it anyway since AI is usually accurate
B) Remove it or replace with verified data
C) Add "approximately" before the number
D) Attribute it to AI as the source

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Unverifiable statistics should be removed or replaced with data you can source. Publishing unverified claims risks credibility and could be factually wrong.

---

### Q1.13
**The "V" in REVIEW stands for "Verify brand voice." What does this involve?**

A) Checking that the content mentions the brand name
B) Ensuring the tone and language match your brand guidelines
C) Adding your logo to the content
D) Including your tagline in every piece

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Verifying brand voice means checking that the tone, word choices, and style match your established brand personality and guidelines.

---

### Q1.14
**What does "Improve clarity" mean in the REVIEW framework?**

A) Make the content longer and more detailed
B) Add more complex vocabulary
C) Simplify and enhance readability
D) Include more statistics

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Improving clarity means cutting unnecessary words, simplifying complex sentences, adding transitions, and making the content easier to read.

---

### Q1.15
**"Enhance with expertise" in the REVIEW framework means:**

A) Adding more AI-generated content
B) Injecting your unique insights, examples, and perspective
C) Using more technical jargon
D) Including competitor information

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** This step involves adding your unique value - personal experiences, industry insights, proprietary examples, and expert perspective that AI cannot provide.

---

### Q1.16
**Which of these is an "AI tell" to watch for?**

A) Specific, detailed examples
B) "In today's fast-paced world..."
C) Conversational tone with personality
D) Industry-specific terminology

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** "In today's fast-paced world" is a classic AI tell - a generic opener that appears frequently in AI outputs. Other tells include "It's important to note" and "At the end of the day."

---

### Q1.17
**Which phrase is most likely to indicate AI-generated content?**

A) "Our client increased leads by 47%"
B) "Here's what I learned from testing this"
C) "It's crucial to leverage synergies"
D) "I made this mistake, so you don't have to"

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** The phrase "leverage synergies" combined with "crucial" is typical AI corporate-speak. The other options show specific data, personal experience, or authentic voice.

---

### Q1.18
**What should you do with perfectly parallel structures in AI content?**

A) Keep them as they show good organization
B) Vary them to sound more natural
C) Add more parallel structures
D) Remove all lists and bullet points

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** While parallel structure is good for clarity, AI often over-uses perfect parallelism in ways that sound robotic. Varying structure makes content sound more human.

---

## Section: AI Tools (7 questions)

### Q1.19
**When should you choose Claude over ChatGPT for a marketing task?**

A) When you need quick, short responses
B) When working with long documents or detailed analysis
C) When generating images
D) When you need real-time information

---

### Q1.20
**What is a key benefit of using a brand context document with AI?**

A) It makes the AI work faster
B) It helps maintain consistent brand voice across outputs
C) It reduces the cost of AI tools

---

### Q1.21
**Which is the best prompt structure for marketing content?**

A) "Write me a blog post about AI"
B) "ROLE: Marketing writer. CONTEXT: B2B SaaS. TASK: Write 500-word blog about AI benefits. FORMAT: Include intro, 3 sections, conclusion."
C) "Make it sound professional and engaging"

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Structured prompts with ROLE, CONTEXT, TASK, and FORMAT elements provide AI with the information needed to produce relevant, targeted content.

---

### Q1.22
**What should you include in a prompt to maintain brand voice?**

A) Just your company name
B) Examples of your existing content and voice descriptors
C) A list of your products
D) Your company's stock price

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Including examples of your best content and describing your voice characteristics (e.g., "professional but friendly, direct, uses short sentences") helps AI match your style.

---

### Q1.23
**When AI output is too generic, what's the best fix?**

A) Use a different AI tool
B) Add more specific context and examples to your prompt
C) Accept that AI can only produce generic content
D) Ask AI to make it "less generic"

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Generic output usually results from vague prompts. Adding specific context, examples, constraints, and details produces more targeted content.

---

### Q1.24
**What's the recommended approach when starting with a new AI tool?**

A) Use it for all projects immediately
B) Test it on low-stakes tasks first while learning its strengths
C) Avoid it until you've read the entire documentation

---

### Q1.25
