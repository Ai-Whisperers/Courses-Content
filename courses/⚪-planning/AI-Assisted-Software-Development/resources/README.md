## Best Practices Summary

### When to Use AI

| Task | Benefit Level | Notes |
|------|---------------|-------|
| Boilerplate code | High | Great for repetitive patterns |
| Documentation | High | Saves significant time |
| Test generation | High | Good starting point |
| Code review | Medium | Supplement human review |
| Debugging | Medium | Good for common issues |
| Architecture | Low | Use for exploration only |

### When NOT to Use AI

- Security-critical code without review
- Code handling sensitive data
- Complex business logic without understanding
- When you can't verify the output
- For decisions you can't explain

## Productivity Metrics

### What to Track

| Metric | How to Measure | Target Improvement |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|
| Code velocity | Lines/features per day | 30-50% increase |
| Review time | Time per PR review | 25% reduction |
| Documentation | Time to document | 60% reduction |
| Test coverage | Coverage percentage | Higher with less time |
| Bug rate | Bugs per feature | No increase |

### Measuring ROI

```
Monthly Time Saved = Hours/week × 4
Monthly Value = Time Saved × Hourly Rate
Annual ROI = (Monthly Value × 12) - Tool Costs
```

**Example:**
- 10 hours saved/week × 4 = 40 hours/month
- 40 hours × $75/hour = $3,000/month
- $3,000 × 12 - $200 (tools) = $35,800/year ROI
