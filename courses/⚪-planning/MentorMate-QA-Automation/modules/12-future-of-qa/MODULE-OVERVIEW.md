## Key Concepts

### AI-Assisted Test Generation
Using AI language models to generate test cases, assertions, and page objects from natural language descriptions or requirements.

### Natural Language Processing (NLP)
Converting human-readable test descriptions into executable test code automatically.

### Self-Healing Tests
Tests that automatically update locators when UI elements change, reducing maintenance burden.

### Prompt Engineering
Crafting effective prompts to get accurate, useful outputs from AI models for testing tasks.

### Cloud Testing
Running tests on cloud-based infrastructure for scalability, parallel execution, and diverse environment coverage.
