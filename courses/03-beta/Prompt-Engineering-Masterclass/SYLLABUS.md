## Advanced Techniques Covered

### Few-Shot Learning
```
Example 1: [input] -> [output]
Example 2: [input] -> [output]
Example 3: [input] -> [output]
Now you: [new input] -> ?
```

### Chain-of-Thought
```
Let's solve this step by step:
1. First, analyze...
2. Then, consider...
3. Finally, conclude...
```

### ReAct Pattern
```
Thought: I need to...
