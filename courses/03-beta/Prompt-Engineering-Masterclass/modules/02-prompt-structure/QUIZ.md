## Section 2: True/False (5 questions, 1 point each)

### Question 11
True or False: Role prompting only works with creative writing tasks.

### Question 12
True or False: Showing an example of desired output format is more effective than just describing it.

### Question 13
True or False: Complex tasks should always be handled in a single comprehensive prompt.

### Question 14
True or False: The position of information in a prompt doesn't matter as long as it's included.

### Question 15
True or False: Specifying audience helps the AI adjust vocabulary and complexity appropriately.

## Section 3: Scenario-Based Questions (5 questions, 1 point each)

### Question 16
**Scenario**: You need the AI to write a technical explanation for two audiences: engineers and executives.

**Question**: What's the BEST approach?

B) Create two separate prompts with different audience specifications
C) Ask the AI to include technical and simple sections
D) Only write for executives since they're more important

**Scenario**: Your prompt asks for "5 marketing ideas" but the AI gives you 7.

**Question**: What should you do to fix this in future prompts?

A) Accept that AI can't count
B) Add "exactly" before the number and reinforce the constraint
C) Ask fewer questions
D) Use a different AI model

### Question 18
**Scenario**: You're getting outputs that are technically correct but too formal for your casual blog.

**Question**: What prompt component should you adjust?

A) Role - make the AI less expert
B) Context - remove business information

## Answer Key

### Section 1: Multiple Choice

1. **B** - Role, Context, Task, Format, Constraints
   - *Explanation: These five components form the anatomy of effective prompts.*

2. **B** - To activate relevant expertise and vocabulary patterns
   - *Explanation: Roles prime the model to access specialized knowledge and appropriate language.*

3. **B** - When the task is complex with multiple components
   - *Explanation: Decomposition helps manage complexity; simple tasks don't need it.*

4. **A** - Context, Role, Action, Format, Tone
   - *Explanation: CRAFT is a mnemonic for the key prompt components.*

5. **C** - "Present as a numbered list of exactly 5 items, each one sentence"
   - *Explanation: Specific format instructions produce consistent, usable outputs.*

6. **B** - The specific needs of the task and what the AI lacks
   - *Explanation: Emphasis depends on task requirements and information gaps.*

7. **B** - Combining multiple roles in one prompt for nuanced expertise
   - *Explanation: Role stacking creates multi-faceted perspectives.*

8. **B** - Specify word counts, paragraph limits, or section constraints
   - *Explanation: Explicit length specifications give controllable results.*

9. **C** - Reinforce style guidelines throughout and specify tone explicitly
   - *Explanation: Long outputs need tone reinforcement for consistency.*

10. **B** - Specific format and constraint specifications
    - *Explanation: Users often state what they want but not how they want it delivered.*

### Section 2: True/False

11. **False** - Role prompting improves outputs across all task types by activating relevant expertise patterns.

12. **True** - Examples demonstrate format more effectively than descriptions alone.

13. **False** - Complex tasks often benefit from decomposition into multiple focused prompts.

14. **False** - Position matters; important information at start/end gets more attention.

15. **True** - Audience specification helps AI calibrate vocabulary and complexity level.

### Section 3: Scenario-Based

16. **B** - Create two separate prompts with different audience specifications
    - *Explanation: Different audiences need tailored content; separate prompts ensure appropriate adaptation.*

17. **B** - Add "exactly" before the number and reinforce the constraint
    - *Explanation: Being more explicit about constraints improves compliance.*

18. **C** - Tone - specify conversational, casual style
    - *Explanation: Tone specification directly addresses the formality mismatch.*

19. **B** - Decompose into sections and create separate prompts for each
    - *Explanation: Large documents are better built section by section.*

20. **B** - "You are a presentation coach. I'm presenting Q3 sales results to my CEO tomorrow. Create an outline with 5 key sections, including an opening hook and clear call to action. Keep it concise—10 slides maximum."
