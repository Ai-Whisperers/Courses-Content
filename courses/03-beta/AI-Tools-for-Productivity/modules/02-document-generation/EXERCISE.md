- 70-79: Satisfactory - complete but needing more refinement
- Below 70: Needs improvement - incomplete or minimal editing

---

## Tips for Success

- **Be specific in prompts** - vague prompts produce generic outputs
- **Show your editing** - the refinement process is as important as the final product
- **Use real scenarios** - adapt exercises to your actual work when possible
- **Document your process** - note what works for future reference
- **Don't settle** - if the first output isn't good, iterate

---

**Challenge**: Create a full proposal document for a new initiative at your (real or fictional) company. Include:
