# How to Learn This Course

Read this BEFORE starting Module 1. It takes 10 minutes and will save you hours.

## The #1 Mistake Students Make

**Learning about AI instead of using it.**

Reading about prompts won't save you time. Using prompts on your actual work will. Every concept in this course should be applied to YOUR job within 24 hours of learning it.

---

## How This Course Works

```
Learn Technique (15 min) → Apply to Real Work (30 min) → Measure Time Saved → Refine → Keep What Works
                                   ↓
                              Use YOUR actual tasks, not just exercises
```

The goal isn't to complete the course. The goal is to **save 5-10 hours per week**.

## Time Commitment

| Path | Time Per Week | Total Duration | Best For |
|------|---------------|----------------|----------|
| **Intensive** | 8-10 hours | 3-4 weeks | Quick transformation |
| **Standard** | 4-6 hours | 5-6 weeks | Working professionals |
| **Part-time** | 2-3 hours | 8-10 weeks | Gradual adoption |

**Minimum session**: 30 minutes. Enough time to learn one technique and apply it once.

## How to Study Each Module

### Step 1: Quick Read (10-15 minutes)
- Skim the lesson for key techniques
- Identify which apply to your current work
- Note the prompt templates provided

### Step 2: Immediate Application (20-30 minutes)
- Pick ONE real task from your job
- Apply the technique to that task
- Note how long it would have taken without AI

### Step 3: Refine (10 minutes)
- Did the output need editing?
- What would make the prompt better?
- Save improved version to your templates

### Step 4: Track Results (2 minutes)
- Log time saved in your tracker
- Note what worked well
- Flag what didn't work

## The "Real Work First" Rule

**Every technique → Your actual work within 24 hours**

| Instead of This | Do This |
|-----------------|---------|
| Practice email prompts on fake emails | Draft your next 3 actual emails with AI |
| Create sample meeting notes | Summarize your next real meeting |
| Generate fake reports | Use AI on your actual weekly report |
| Do exercises with sample data | Analyze your real spreadsheet |

If you can't apply a technique to real work within 24 hours, skip it and come back later.

## Your ROI Tracking System

This is THE most important part of the course. Create this tracker:

```markdown
# AI Productivity Tracker

## Week of: [DATE]

| Task | Without AI | With AI | Saved | Quality |
|------|------------|---------|-------|---------|
| Email responses (5) | 45 min | 15 min | 30 min | Same |
| Meeting prep | 30 min | 10 min | 20 min | Better |
| Weekly report | 2 hrs | 45 min | 75 min | Same |
| Research summary | 3 hrs | 1 hr | 2 hrs | Better |

**Total Time Saved This Week:** 4 hrs 5 min
**Running Total:** [CUMULATIVE]
```

**Why this matters**: When you can say "AI saved me 8 hours last week," you'll never go back.

## What Makes Top Students Different

| Top 10% Do This | Bottom 10% Do This |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| Apply every technique to real work | Only do course exercises |
| Track time saved religiously | Don't measure ROI |
| Build a personal prompt library | Use prompts once and forget |
| Test prompts on both Claude and ChatGPT | Only use one tool |
| Share wins with colleagues | Keep learnings to themselves |
| Start with high-frequency tasks | Start with edge cases |

## The 80/20 of Productivity AI

Focus on these high-impact areas first:

| Task Category | Time Saved | Frequency | Priority |
|---------------|------------|-----------|----------|
| Email drafting | 2-5 min each | Daily | START HERE |
| Meeting summaries | 15-30 min each | Weekly | HIGH |
| Report writing | 30-60 min each | Weekly | HIGH |
| Data summarization | 15-45 min each | Weekly | MEDIUM |

## If AI Output Isn't Good Enough

Follow this improvement cycle:

```
Output not useful?
       │
       ▼
Add more context (background, constraints, audience)
       │
       ▼
Still not good?
       │
       ▼
Specify the format explicitly (bullets, sections, length)
       │
       ▼
Still not good?
       │
       ▼
Give an example of what "good" looks like
       │
       ▼
Still not good?
       │
       ▼
Break the task into smaller steps
       │
       ▼
Still not good after 3 attempts?
       │
       ▼
This task might not be suitable for AI (yet)
```

## Tracking Your Progress

Use this checklist for each module:

```markdown
## Module [X] Progress

- [ ] Read lesson (understood key techniques)
- [ ] Applied to at least ONE real work task
- [ ] Tracked time saved
- [ ] Saved best prompts to my library
- [ ] Passed quiz (70%+)
- [ ] Can explain ROI to a colleague
```

Copy this into a file called `MY-PROGRESS.md` and update as you go.

## The Ultimate Success Metric

**By end of this course, you should be able to say:**

"I save [X] hours per week using AI for:
- [TASK 1]: [Y] hours saved
- [TASK 2]: [Z] hours saved
- [TASK 3]: [W] hours saved

That's worth $[AMOUNT] per year to my employer."

If you can't make this statement with real numbers, keep practicing.
