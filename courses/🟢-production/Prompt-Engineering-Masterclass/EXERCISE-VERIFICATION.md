- Module 3 self-consistency exercises could take longer if student is thorough
- Module 6 naturally extends into final project (by design)

---

## Recommendations for Students

### Before Starting Exercises:
1. Set up AI tool accounts (Claude.ai or ChatGPT)
2. Create note-taking system (Google Docs, Notion, or text files)
3. Bookmark OpenAI tokenizer page
4. Allocate uninterrupted time blocks

### During Exercises:
1. Follow parts sequentially (they build on each other)
2. Don't skip analysis questions (key learning happens here)
3. Save all outputs (useful for reflection and final project)
4. Refer to solution guides only after attempting yourself

### After Exercises:
1. Complete reflection questions
2. Review solution guide to see alternative approaches
3. Take quiz to verify understanding
4. Start building final project library

---

## Recommendations for Instructors

### Facilitation Tips:
1. **Module 1:** Emphasize understanding "why" over memorizing facts
2. **Module 2:** Show multiple examples of same concept (role variations)
3. **Module 3:** Advanced patterns need practice - expect initial confusion
4. **Module 4:** Have students share personas for peer feedback
5. **Module 5:** Real iteration takes time - encourage patience
6. **Module 6:** This naturally starts their final project

### Common Student Struggles (from exercise design):
- Module 3: Understanding when to use which advanced pattern
- Module 4: Making personas specific enough (solution guide helps)
- Module 5: Systematic debugging vs. random trial-and-error
- Module 6: Balancing documentation detail (examples help)

### Grading Notes:
- Use provided rubrics (100 points each)
- Solution guides show expected quality level
- Partial credit appropriate for good attempts
- Reflection questions reveal depth of understanding
