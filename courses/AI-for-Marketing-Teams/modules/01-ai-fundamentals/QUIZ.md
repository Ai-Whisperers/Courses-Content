### Multiple Choice
1. **B** - AI excels at first drafts and scaling consistent content production. It doesn't create truly original concepts (A), can't replace strategic thinking (C), and doesn't guarantee accuracy (D).

2. **B** - AI struggles with nuanced brand voice and current events due to knowledge cutoffs. It can handle long-form content (A), can generate variations (C), and doesn't require supervision for every word (D).

3. **B** - Verify brand voice. The REVIEW framework: Read, Evaluate accuracy, Verify brand voice, Improve clarity, Enhance with expertise, Watch for AI tells.

4. **C** - Disclosure is recommended for heavily AI-generated content, especially realistic AI images. Many platforms require disclosure for AI images in ads. Neither "never" (A) nor "only images" (B) is accurate.

5. **B** - The brand context document maintains consistency across AI sessions. It doesn't train the model (A), can't prevent all errors (C), and content should always be reviewed (D).

6. **B** - Claude.ai, Canva, and Google Gemini are all available with free tiers and recommended for starting the course.

### True/False
7. **False** - Google does not penalize AI content if it's helpful, high-quality, and provides value. Quality matters, not whether AI was used.

8. **True** - AI models have training cutoffs and don't have access to real-time information or very recent events.

9. **False** - AI content should always be reviewed, edited, and enhanced with human expertise before publishing.

10. **True** - "In today's fast-paced world" is a classic AI tell/cliché that should typically be replaced with more specific, original language.

11. **False** - AI frequently hallucinates URLs and links. All links should be verified before publishing.

### Scenario-Based
12. **C** - Verify the source before publishing or remove/replace it. AI often fabricates statistics, so fact-checking is essential. Simply removing it (B) wastes the opportunity if it's real; publishing as-is (A) risks misinformation.

13. **C** - Edit to match brand voice while keeping the core message. This balances efficiency with brand consistency. Complete rewrite (B) wastes AI's value; vague instructions (D) likely won't fix the issue.

14. **C** - A site-wide policy or occasional footer disclosure is appropriate for blogs with human editing and fact-checking. This is transparent without being disruptive.

### Short Answer
15. Accept any three from: "In today's fast-paced world," "It's important to note that," "Let's dive in," "In conclusion," "Whether you're a... or a...," "Look no further," "Unlock the power of," "Take your X to the next level," "At the end of the day," "Game-changer," "Cutting-edge," "Leverage," "Seamlessly," or similar generic AI phrases.
