3. **B** - Variety prevents audience fatigue, helps you test what resonates with your audience, and keeps the feed interesting.

4. **C** - A content brief clarifies your goals, target audience, unique angle, and constraints before you start generating, leading to better AI output.

5. **C** - "I lost $50,000 on a campaign..." is a strong hook because it's specific, creates curiosity, and promises value. The others are generic and unmemorable.
