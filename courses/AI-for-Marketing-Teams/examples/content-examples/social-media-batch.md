## AI Output + Edits

### Post 1: Story Post

**AI Generated:**
```
I made a costly mistake with AI content last year.

We had a client launch coming up, and I thought AI could handle the
blog content while we focused on strategy. We generated 10 blog posts
in a day. Felt like a win.

Then the client's CEO called. "This doesn't sound like us at all."

She was right. The content was technically accurate but completely
devoid of their brand's personality. We had to rewrite everything.

The lesson? AI is a powerful tool, but it needs guardrails. Now we
never generate content without a detailed brand voice document and
human review at every stage.

AI can write. Only you can make it sound like you.

What's your biggest AI content lesson? Share below.

We lost a client because of AI content.

Last year, we had a product launch deadline and thought AI could
handle 10 blog posts while we focused on strategy.

Generated them in a day. Shipped them.

Then the CEO called: "This doesn't sound like us at all."

She was right. Technically accurate. Zero personality. We had to
rewrite everything—and lost the retainer anyway.

The lesson cost us $8,000/month.

Here's what we do differently now:

→ Brand voice document before ANY AI content
→ Human review on every piece (not optional)
→ AI writes 60%, we add the 40% that matters

AI can write words. Only you can make them yours.

What's been your most expensive AI lesson?

**Changes Made:**
- Stronger hook (specific consequence)
- Added dollar amount for impact
- Structured with arrows for scannability
- More direct CTA question

### Post 2: Tip Post

**AI Generated:**
```
Here's a simple tip that improved our AI content quality by 40%.

Before every AI session, we paste a "brand context document" that
includes our voice characteristics, words we use, and examples of
our best content.

It takes 30 seconds and transforms generic AI output into something
that actually sounds like us.

Most people skip this step because it feels redundant. But AI doesn't
know your brand unless you tell it—every single time.

Try it today: Create a one-page brand context doc and paste it before
your next AI prompt.

Your content will thank you.

One change. 40% better AI content.

Before every Claude/ChatGPT session, we paste our "brand context doc."

It includes:
→ Voice characteristics (3 adjectives + examples)
→ Words we use vs. words we never use
→ 2 paragraphs of our best content as reference

Takes 30 seconds. Transforms generic output into branded content.

Why it works: AI defaults to "average internet writing" without
context. Your brand doc is the difference between generic and yours.

Most skip this because it feels redundant.

It's not. AI has no memory of your brand between sessions.

Template in comments (steal it).

**Changes Made:**
- Punchier hook
- Added specific structure with arrows
- Explained WHY it works
- Promised value in comments (engagement driver)

### Post 3: Contrarian Post

**AI Generated:**
```
Unpopular opinion: AI won't replace marketers. Marketers who use AI
will replace marketers who don't.

Everyone's worried about the wrong thing. The threat isn't that AI
will take your job. It's that someone who uses AI effectively will
do your job better and faster.

I've seen marketing teams cut content production time by 60% while
maintaining quality. Not by letting AI do everything, but by using
it strategically.

The real skill isn't prompt engineering. It's knowing when AI helps
and when it hurts.

Stop fearing AI. Start learning how to direct it.

What do you think—overhyped or underutilized?

Hot take: The "AI will replace marketers" debate is a distraction.

Here's what's actually happening:

Marketers using AI well are getting promoted.
Marketers ignoring AI are getting left behind.
AI itself is replacing... nothing.

I've watched two marketing managers handle AI differently this year:

Manager A: "I don't trust AI. I'll stick to what works."
Manager B: "AI does my first drafts. I do the thinking."

Manager B now leads a team of 6. Manager A is job hunting.

The skill that matters isn't "prompt engineering."

It's judgment: knowing when AI helps and when it hurts.

That's not replaceable by a machine.

Agree or disagree?

**Changes Made:**
- Made contrarian point sharper
- Added concrete example (two managers)
- Removed generic "unpopular opinion" opener
- Stronger structure with contrast

### Post 4: Data Post

**AI Generated:**

New data on AI content marketing:

According to recent studies, 65% of marketers are now using AI for
content creation. But here's the interesting part—only 23% say they're
satisfied with the quality.

That's a 42-point gap between adoption and satisfaction.

What's causing it? Our analysis points to three issues:
1. No brand voice guidelines
2. Publishing without editing
3. Expecting AI to replace strategy

The marketers seeing results aren't using AI differently. They're
using it more deliberately.

AI is a tool. Results depend on how you use it.

65% of marketers use AI for content.

Only 23% are happy with it.

That's a 42-point satisfaction gap. What's going wrong?

We surveyed 150 marketing teams and found 3 patterns:

The UNHAPPY 77%:
→ No brand guidelines for AI
→ Publish AI content without editing
→ Expect AI to replace thinking

The SATISFIED 23%:
→ Detailed brand context docs
→ Edit everything (60/40 rule)
→ Use AI for speed, humans for quality

Same tools. Different results.

The gap isn't the technology. It's the process.

Which camp is your team in?

**Changes Made:**
- Hook with the striking stat immediately
- Visual structure with contrasting groups
- Added specific survey number for credibility
- Made the insight actionable

### Post 5: Engagement Post

```
Quick question for marketing leaders:

What's ONE task you wish you could hand off to AI completely?

I'll go first: First drafts of case studies. They take forever to
structure, and AI actually does a decent job getting the bones down.

Your turn—what would you automate if you could?

Drop your answer below. I'm genuinely curious what's eating up your time.

Marketing leaders: What's the ONE task you'd automate tomorrow?

I'll start.

For me: Case study first drafts.

Structuring the challenge → solution → result flow takes 2+ hours.
AI gets me 70% there in 10 minutes. I add the client's voice and
specific details.

Saved 6+ hours last month alone.

Your turn:

If AI could handle ONE marketing task perfectly, what would free up
your time the most?

→ Content repurposing?
→ Social captions?
→ Email sequences?
→ Something else?

Drop your answer. Stealing the best ideas for a future post.

**Changes Made:**
- More specific personal example with numbers
- Added options to lower friction for responses
- Clear value exchange (will use answers)
- More direct CTA
