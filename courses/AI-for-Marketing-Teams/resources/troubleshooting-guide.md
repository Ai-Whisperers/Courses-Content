## Content Quality Issues

### Problem: AI output sounds generic

**Symptoms:**
- Phrases like "In today's fast-paced world"
- Could apply to any company
- Lacks specific examples

**Solutions:**
1. Add more context to your prompt (brand voice, specific details)
2. Include examples of your best content in the prompt
3. Request specific examples, data points, or scenarios
4. Edit to add your unique perspective and examples
5. Use voice calibration: "Based on these examples of our content, match this voice..."

### Problem: AI doesn't match brand voice

**Symptoms:**
- Tone is too formal/casual
- Uses wrong terminology
- Doesn't feel like "us"

**Solutions:**
1. Create and paste your brand context document
2. Include 2-3 examples of your best content
3. Explicitly state: "Our tone is [X], we say [X], we never say [X]"
4. Ask AI to describe your voice from examples, then use that description
5. Edit output to match voice, track common fixes for future prompts

### Problem: AI makes factual errors

**Symptoms:**
- Statistics seem made up
- Links don't work
- Claims can't be verified

**Solutions:**
1. Always fact-check AI-generated statistics
2. Never trust AI-generated URLs - verify or find real ones
3. Ask AI to note where claims need verification
4. Use AI for structure/draft, research for facts
5. Prompt: "For any statistics, note [VERIFY] so I can check them"

## Technical Issues

### Problem: AI gives truncated responses

**Symptoms:**

- Missing deliverables

**Solutions:**
1. Request content in smaller chunks

### Problem: AI forgets context mid-conversation

**Symptoms:**

**Solutions:**
1. Keep important context in each prompt

5. Keep brand context document handy to re-paste

### Problem: AI won't do what you ask

**Symptoms:**

5. Some requests may legitimately conflict with AI guidelines

---
