## Module-Specific Speaking Notes

### Module 1: Introduction to AI-Assisted Development

**PRE-SESSION PREP**
- Have Claude Code open and ready for live demo
- Prepare example codebase for exploration
- Test AI response times
- Have backup screenshots

**KEY MESSAGES TO EMPHASIZE**
1. AI augments, doesn't replace QA thinking
2. Always validate AI output
3. Context is crucial for quality results
4. Iteration improves AI responses

**DEMONSTRATIONS**
Demo 1: First AI interaction
- Start with simple question
- Show how AI responds
- Demonstrate follow-up questions
- Highlight conversation flow

Demo 2: Code explanation
- Open complex function
- Ask AI to explain
- Show how to ask for clarification
- Compare AI explanation with manual analysis

**COMMON STUDENT CONCERNS**
1. "Will AI replace my job?"
   - No, it makes you more valuable
   - Focus shifts to strategy and validation
   - Human judgment remains essential

2. "What if AI makes mistakes?"
   - It will! That's expected
   - Your role: catch and correct
   - Shows importance of QA skills

3. "How do I know what to trust?"
   - Always validate against documentation
   - Run code to verify it works
   - Use multiple sources

**TIMING BREAKDOWN**
- Introduction: 5 min
- Concept explanation: 15 min
- Live demos: 20 min
- Student exploration: 15 min
- Q&A: 5 min
Total: 60 minutes

**ENERGY MANAGEMENT**
- Start high energy to engage
- Demos are natural energy peaks
- Check energy at 30-min mark
- End with enthusiasm for next module

---

### Module 2: Context Engineering

**PRE-SESSION PREP**
- Prepare example CLAUDE.md files
- Have good/bad prompt examples ready
- Test prompt variations
- Show real impact of context

**KEY MESSAGES TO EMPHASIZE**
1. Quality of output = Quality of input + Context
2. Context hierarchy matters
3. Iterative refinement is normal
4. Document successful patterns

**DEMONSTRATIONS**
Demo 1: Same prompt, different contexts
- Show generic prompt result
- Add context, show improvement
- Add constraints, show refinement
- Compare all three outputs

Demo 2: Building a CLAUDE.md file
- Start from blank file
- Add project info progressively
- Show AI output improvement
- Highlight what to include/exclude

**INTERACTIVE EXERCISES**
Exercise 1: Prompt improvement (10 min)
- Give students weak prompt
- Ask them to improve it
- Share results
- Discuss what worked

Exercise 2: Write CLAUDE.md (15 min)
- Students create for sample project
- Pair-share for feedback
- Instructor reviews best examples

**COMMON MISTAKES TO ADDRESS**
1. Too vague: "Write tests"
   Better: "Write Jest unit tests for the UserService class focusing on authentication methods"

2. Missing context: Not mentioning frameworks
   Include: "Using React 18, TypeScript, and Testing Library"

3. No output format specified
   Add: "Output as separate test files with descriptive names"

**TIMING BREAKDOWN**
- Recap Module 1: 3 min
- Context concepts: 12 min
- Demo 1: 10 min
- Demo 2: 10 min
- Interactive exercises: 25 min
Total: 60 minutes
