we want to prepare the summer courses for the fp una

@courses/Summer-Courses-University/Cursos/UniDeleteme/FPUNA like this example

but better and more detaild



we want to have 1 core course
that explains the fundamentals to everyone

we want toshow them them how to setup their IA stack
and how to prepare everyhting they could need for the projects they work on

for example
setup and install opencode + oh my opencode 
explain how to configure skills mcps and all the configuration for AIs
show a 1 shot project live
and show how to use it for diferent areas 
and here i want to branch for each student area a separate course

AI for aeronautics autocad +mcps etc 
most things wont be the same as for electricians /electrical engeneer

and for marketing 
etc

so we want to organize all the common sub areas of all students and also prepare for their specific areas
