# ⚠️ Course Content Has Moved

## This course has been consolidated!

The QA-Automation-with-AI course content has been **merged** with the MentorMate QA Automation course to create a comprehensive, unified learning experience.

---

## 📍 New Location

### Main Course
👉 **[MentorMate-QA-Automation/](../MentorMate-QA-Automation/)**

This new combined course includes:
- ✅ All core QA automation fundamentals
- ✅ Playwright, Postman, CI/CD training
- ✅ AI-assisted development patterns (from this course)
- ✅ 4-week structured Sunday class format
- ✅ Complete Module 1, 11, and 12

## 🤖 AI-Specific Content

All AI-integration materials from this course are now at:

👉 **[MentorMate-QA-Automation/ai-integration/](../MentorMate-QA-Automation/ai-integration/)**

This includes:
- `/prompts/` - All tested prompts
- `/templates/` - CLAUDE.md and AI templates
- `/resources/` - AI guides and cheatsheets

## 🎯 How to Use the New Structure

### Option 1: Traditional Track
Focus on the core modules in `MentorMate-QA-Automation/modules/` without AI tools.

### Option 2: AI-Enhanced Track
Follow the main course and supplement with AI materials in `ai-integration/`.

### Option 3: Blended Approach
Let your instructor guide you through a balanced mix of both approaches.
