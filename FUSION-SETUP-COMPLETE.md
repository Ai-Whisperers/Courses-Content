# Fusion 360 Integration: READY ✅

I have successfully installed the bridge script into your Fusion 360 API folder.

**Location:** `C:\Users\Alejandro\AppData\Roaming\Autodesk\Autodesk Fusion 360\API\Scripts\RunAgentScript.py`

## How to use it NOW

1.  **Open Autodesk Fusion 360**.
2.  Press **Shift + S** on your keyboard (or go to *Utilities* > *Scripts and Add-Ins*).
3.  Click on the **"Scripts"** tab.
4.  Look for **"RunAgentScript"** in the list under "My Scripts".
    *   *If you don't see it, try restarting Fusion 360.*
5.  Select it and click **Run**.

## What happens when you run it?
It will execute whatever code is currently in:
`courses/02-development/FPUNA-2026/03-INGENIERIA-AERONAUTICA/modules/01-cad-with-ai/fusion-scripts/agent_generated_script.py`

Right now, that file contains a script to **Create a 50mm Cube**.
So you should see a cube appear instantly!

## Next Steps
Ask the AI Agent to design something else:
> "Design a propeller blade in Fusion 360"

The Agent will rewrite the file, and you just click **Run** again to see the new design.
