## Required Improvements

### 1. Add Prerequisites Section (30 min)
**Location**: After line 26 (after analogía, before Parte 1)

**Content needed**:
- Research background required (basic statistics, academic writing)
- Software/tools (none required - conceptual module)
- Self-assessment (4-5 questions)
- Time estimates

### 2. Add Assessment Quiz (45 min)
**Location**: Before "Recursos Esenciales" (line 1001)

**Content needed**:
- 10 questions (mix of multiple choice, true/false, short answer)
- Cover all 6 parts of module
- Include answers with explanations
- Grading criteria

### 3. Add Transitions (15 min)
**Between major parts**:
- Part 1 → Part 2: Why experimental design matters
- Part 2 → Part 3: Importance of sampling
- Part 3 → Part 4: Ensuring quality (validity/reliability)
- Part 4 → Part 5: Ethical foundation
- Part 5 → Part 6: Practical documentation
