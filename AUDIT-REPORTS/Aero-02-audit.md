## Recommendation

⚠️ **NEEDS COMPLETION** - Add missing content first, then standard enhancements

**Immediate actions**:
1. Complete XFoil tutorial section (~200 lines)
2. Add CFD setup section (~150 lines)
3. Then add prerequisites + quiz

**Time to complete fully**: 3-4 hours

---

**For now**: Adding minimal prerequisites + quiz to existing content
