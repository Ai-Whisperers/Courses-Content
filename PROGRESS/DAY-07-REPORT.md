**Solution:** Progressive explanation - concepts first, then implementation  
**Result:** Clear learning path from basics to advanced

### Challenge 2: Vector Database Options
**Issue:** 4+ vector databases, students need guidance  
**Decision:** Create comprehensive comparison table with recommendations  
**Result:** Clear decision-making framework for different use cases

### Challenge 3: Exercise Scope
