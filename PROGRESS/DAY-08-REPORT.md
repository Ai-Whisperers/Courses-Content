## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Agent Complexity
**Issue:** Agents are conceptually harder than RAG systems  
**Solution:** Started with simple concepts, built progressively  
**Result:** Clear learning path from basics to autonomous systems

### Challenge 2: ReAct Pattern
**Issue:** Most tutorials don't explain how ReAct works internally  
**Decision:** Include custom ReAct implementation (Part 2)  
**Rationale:** Understanding internals helps with debugging and advanced use

### Challenge 3: Tool Design
**Issue:** Bad tool descriptions = agent failures  
**Solution:** Extensive best practices section + examples  
**Result:** Students learn critical importance of tool design
