## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I work with a partner?**  
A: Projects are individual, but you can help each other debug and review code.

**Q: What if I can't finish all planned features?**  
A: Submit what you have. It's better to have fewer features working perfectly than many half-done features.

**Q: Can I use external libraries?**  
A: Yes, but document why you chose them and ensure they're properly licensed.

**Q: What if my deployment fails?**  
A: Contact instructors immediately. We have backup deployment options.

**Q: Can I switch project ideas mid-week?**  
A: Switching after Day 2 is discouraged. Choose carefully during planning.

**Q: How much should I use OpenCode?**  
A: Use it extensively, but understand the code it generates. Document your usage.

**Q: What if I find a bug during presentation?**  
A: Acknowledge it and explain how you'd fix it. Debugging is part of development.

**Violations will result in project failure and potential course dismissal.**

---

## Success Tips

1. **Start Early**: Don't wait until Week 9 to think about your project
2. **Scope Appropriately**: Better to do fewer features well than many poorly
3. **Commit Often**: Small, frequent commits are better than large ones
4. **Test Continuously**: Don't wait until the end to test
5. **Document as You Go**: Don't leave documentation for the last day
6. **Use OpenCode Effectively**: Learn to write good prompts
7. **Ask for Help**: Don't struggle alone when stuck
8. **Deploy Early**: Deploy Week 9 Day 1 and iterate
9. **Practice Your Demo**: A smooth demo makes a great impression
10. **Have Fun**: This is your chance to build something you're proud of!
