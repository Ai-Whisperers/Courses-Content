# FPUNA Course Strategy & Architecture
## Dual-Track Approach for Maximum Impact

**Date**: January 14, 2026  
**Status**: Strategic Plan  
**Stakeholder**: FPUNA (Facultad Politécnica UNA)

---

## Executive Summary

After analyzing the existing 6 FPUNA courses and the original 10-week program vision, we recommend a **dual-track approach** that serves two distinct market segments:

1. **Main Program**: 10-week comprehensive AI & development training (Summer 2026)
2. **Extension Workshops**: 2-day intensive skill-specific courses (ongoing)
