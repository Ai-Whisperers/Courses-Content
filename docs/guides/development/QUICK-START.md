2. AI Tools for Productivity (8 hrs)
3. Prompt Engineering Masterclass (4 hrs)

**Timeline:** 6 weeks instead of 12 weeks
**Effort:** ~105 hours instead of 308 hours
**Cost:** $20/month (Claude Pro) instead of $30K+ in developer salaries

---

## Week 1: Get Started (This Week!)

### Day 1: Setup (2 hours)

**Step 1:** Subscribe to Claude Pro ($20/month)
- Go to claude.ai
- Upgrade to Pro plan
- You now have unlimited conversations

**Step 2:** Read the main guide
- Open `AI-ASSISTED-COURSE-DEVELOPMENT-GUIDE.md`
- Skim the whole document (30 min)
- Focus on "Core Strategy" section

**Step 3:** Review Module 1 (your quality template)
- Read `courses/Introduction-to-AI-for-Business-Professionals/modules/01-ai-demystified/README.md`
- This is what "good" looks like
- Every module you create should match this quality

---

### Day 2: Create Your First Module (4 hours)

**Morning: Prepare (1 hour)**

1. Open a new Claude conversation
2. Start with this context message:

```markdown
# Course Development Context

I'm developing professional AI training courses for business executives. I need help creating high-quality educational content.

## Quality Standard
This is Module 1, which represents our quality benchmark:
[Copy and paste the entire Module 1 README.md here]

## My Task
Generate Module 2: Business Value & ROI for the Introduction to AI for Business Professionals course.

Please review Module 1 carefully and match its:
- Writing style and tone
- Content depth
- Example quality
- Structure
- Length (400-450 lines)

I'll provide the detailed prompt next.
```

3. Once Claude confirms, paste the Module 2 generation prompt from:
   `prompts/course-development/01-generate-module-content.md`

4. Fill in the placeholders:
   - Module 2: Business Value & ROI
   - 60 minutes
   - From SYLLABUS.md, paste Module 2 requirements

**Afternoon: Review & Iterate (3 hours)**

1. Claude will generate Module 2 (takes ~2 minutes)

2. Use the quality checklist:
   - Open `QUALITY-CONTROL-CHECKLIST.md`
   - Go through Module Content Checklist
   - Score each section

3. If score is <90%, ask Claude to improve:
   ```markdown
   This is good, but needs improvement in these areas:
   - [Specific issue 1]
   - [Specific issue 2]
   - [Specific issue 3]

   Please revise the module addressing these points while maintaining the overall quality.
   ```

4. Once you hit 90%+, save Module 2!

**End of Day 2:** You have your first AI-generated module ✅

### Day 3: Refine Your Process (4 hours)

**Generate Module 3** using the same workflow:
- New conversation (or continue existing)
- Provide context
- Use generation prompt
- Review with checklist
- Iterate to 90%+
- Save

**By now you should be getting faster:**
- Day 2: 4 hours
- Day 3: 3 hours
- Day 4+: 2 hours per module

## Common Challenges & Solutions

### "Claude's output is too generic"
**Solution:**
```markdown
This is too generic. Please revise with:
- Specific company names and real examples
- Actual metrics and dollar amounts
- Current 2024-2025 references
- Industry-specific details
Make it feel like you've actually worked with these companies.
```

### "The tone doesn't match Module 1"
**Solution:**
```markdown
The tone is too [formal/technical/casual]. Please revise to match Module 1:
- Conversational but professional
- Uses "you" language
- Includes rhetorical questions
- Empowering, not intimidating
- Light analogies when helpful
```

### "Content is too short"
**Solution:**
```markdown
This is only [X] lines. Please expand to 400-450 lines by:
- Adding 3 more industry examples
- Expanding best practices section
- Adding more detailed explanations
- Including additional frameworks
```

### "Examples are outdated"
**Solution:**
```markdown
Please update all examples to 2024-2025:
- Current AI tools (ChatGPT-4, Claude 3.5, Gemini)
- Recent company examples
- Updated pricing
- Latest statistics
No examples older than 2023.
```

Don't skip quality control
90%+ or iterate

### 3. Save Good Prompts
When something works well, document it
Build your prompt library

### 4. Iterate Quickly
Don't overthink
Get 90% from Claude, polish the last 10% yourself if faster

### 5. Stay Focused
One module at a time
Complete before moving to next

### 6. Document Learnings
What worked?
What didn't?
Improve daily

### 7. Trust the Process
First module feels slow
By module 5-6, you'll be flying
