## Common Grading Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Partial Completion

**Situation:** Student completes 70% of requirements

**Approach:**
- Grade what's present against rubric
- Maximum possible score = completion percentage
- Provide feedback on missing parts
- Offer revision opportunity if policy allows

### Scenario 2: AI-Generated Without Understanding

**Situation:** Student submits AI code but can't explain it

**Approach:**
- Reduce score for "understanding" criteria
- Note in feedback: must demonstrate comprehension
- Recommend revision with explanation
- Not academic dishonesty if properly documented

### Scenario 3: Late Submission

**Situation:** Assignment submitted after deadline

**Approach:**
1. Check for approved extensions
2. Apply late penalty per policy:
   - 1-2 days: -10%
   - 3-7 days: -25%
   - >7 days: Contact instructor
3. Grade normally, then apply penalty
4. Document in records

### Scenario 4: Exceptional Work

**Situation:** Submission exceeds expectations

**Approach:**
- Award full marks for exceeded criteria
- Consider bonus points if available
- Document for potential showcase
- Provide positive reinforcement

---

## Academic Integrity

### Red Flags

- Identical submissions from multiple students
- Code style inconsistent with student's other work
- Unable to explain submitted work
- Timestamps suggest impossible completion speed
- References to content not in course

### Response Protocol

1. **Document** the concern
2. **Review** submission history
3. **Contact** student for explanation
4. **Escalate** if needed to course lead
5. **Apply** appropriate consequences

### Consequences

| Severity | First Offense | Second Offense |
|----------|---------------|----------------|
| Minor | Warning + revision | Zero grade |
| Major | Zero grade | Course failure |
| Severe | Course failure | Academic review |

## Grading Calibration

### Consistency Checks

Before grading a cohort:
1. Review rubric criteria
2. Grade 2-3 samples independently
3. Compare scores with other instructors
4. Calibrate understanding

### Borderline Cases

When a score is within 2% of a grade boundary:
1. Review submission again
2. Consider holistic performance
3. When in doubt, favor the student
4. Document reasoning
