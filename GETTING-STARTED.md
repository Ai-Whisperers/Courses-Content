## Course Structure

All courses follow this pattern:

```
course-name/
├── README.md           # Course overview - START HERE
├── SYLLABUS.md         # Complete curriculum
├── modules/            # Course content
│   ├── 01-topic/
│   │   ├── README.md   # Module overview
│   │   ├── LESSON.md   # Main content
│   │   ├── EXERCISE.md # Hands-on practice
│   │   └── QUIZ.md     # Self-assessment
│   └── ...
├── examples/           # Code examples
└── resources/          # Additional materials
```

**Learning flow:**
1. Read module README
2. Study the LESSON
3. Complete the EXERCISE
4. Test yourself with the QUIZ
5. Move to next module
